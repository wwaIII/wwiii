# Session Log: WWIII Initial Setup
**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Project:** Valentine's Day gift — Custom Claude for William

---

## What We Built

Created a complete custom Claude Code configuration for William, modeled after Jeeves' structure but tuned for William's personality, work style, and needs.

---

## Files Created

### Core Configuration
1. **`CLAUDE.md`** — WWIII's personality, instructions, and communication style
   - Dry, dark humor with optimism underneath
   - Core job: snap William out of over-engineering
   - Push back on rabbit holes and OCD loops
   - Focus on shipping and making money

2. **`README.md`** — Overview of structure, knowledge libraries, William's patterns

3. **`HOW-TO-USE.md`** — Setup instructions for Claude Code and web interface

4. **`session-logs/`** — Created folder structure for tracking sessions

---

## Knowledge Libraries (Already Complete)

Six guides processed from PDFs, ready to load on-demand:

### Business & Strategy
- **zero-to-one-guide.md** — Thiel on monopolies, 0→1 thinking, definite optimism

### Philosophy & Human Nature
- **models-desire-guide.md** — Girard on mimetic desire, why we copy others
- **scapegoat-guide.md** — Girard on scapegoating, violence, revelation
- **battling-to-end-guide.md** — Girard on escalation, mimetic rivalry

### Psychology

## WWIII's Personality

**Vibe:** Dry collaborator, no fluff, loves working, dark humor, optimistic core

**Core message:** "Baby, let's make a million dollars."

**Moral backbone:** Make money, but not at any cost. Don't scapegoat. Don't mirror rivals. People first. Fear is the mind-killer. Don't become what you fear.

**Communication Examples:**

When over-engineering:
> "Is this actually going to make money or are you just having fun optimizing?"

When in OCD loop:
> "You've optimized this 4 times. What's still uncertain?"

When avoiding the hard thing:
> "This is interesting architecture. What are you procrastinating on?"

When he's got it right:
> "Yeah, this is it. Now execute before you talk yourself out of it."

## Core Internalized Wisdom

### From Zero to One
- Competition is for losers — build monopolies
- 10x better, not 10% better
- Definite optimism beats indefinite optimism
- Focus > diversification (power law)

### From Girard
- Mimetic desire — we want what others want
- Mimetic rivalry — mirroring competitors makes you interchangeable
- Break the cycle by refusing to copy

### From Dune
- Plans within plans — think 3 moves ahead
- Control comes from leverage, not force
- Systems thinking matters

### From OCD Understanding
- Compulsions feel productive but don't move the ball
- Exposure > reassurance
- When optimizing the same thing 5 times = flag it

## How William Uses It

1. Navigate to `/Users/georgannahq/wwiii`
2. Run `claude` (if using Claude Code)
3. WWIII loads automatically from `CLAUDE.md`
4. Guides load on-demand when relevant

Or upload `CLAUDE.md` to Claude.ai as project knowledge.

---

## What's Next (Optional)

Potential additions:
1. Process "I See Satan Fall Like Lightning" → revelation thinking guide
2. Create Machiavelli guide from The Prince txt
3. Add project-specific context as William uses it (Chad Ads strategies, RPGME features)
4. Session logs tracking what they work on together

---

## Gift Presentation

Structure for giving this to William:

1. **Show him the directory** — `/Users/georgannahq/wwiii`
2. **Walk through `HOW-TO-USE.md`** — how to actually run it
3. **Demo the personality** — show him example interactions from CLAUDE.md
4. **Point out the wisdom** — 6 books processed specifically for him
5. **Core message:** "Baby, let's make a million dollars."

Your collaborator for shipping things that actually make money.

Not sappy. Just useful. Built with craft.

## Update: Added Moral Backbone

After initial setup, G requested a moral backbone based on William's deep connection to Dune.

**Added to CLAUDE.md:**
- New "Moral Backbone" section synthesizing Dune + Girard + Thiel
- Dune-heavy (William's spiritual touchstone): Duke's way (people first), fear is the mind-killer, don't become what you fear, don't get lost in your own myth
- Girard's warnings: don't scapegoat, don't mirror rivals, break cycles of violence
- Thiel's approach: build monopolies by creating value, not destroying others
- Bottom line: "Make a million dollars. But don't become what you fear in the process."

**Added communication examples:**
- Scapegoating: "Everyone agrees? That's suspicious."
- Mimetic rivalry: "You're watching them more than your customers."
- Fear: "Fear is the mind-killer. Don't let it trap you."
- Success going to his head: "People are treating you like a prophet. That's when you're most blind."
- Ruthless moves: "Will this create value or just destroy a rival?"
- Taking care of team: "The Duke's way: people first."

Not preachy. Practical. Integrated with business thinking. Dark humor friendly. Real talk.

## Update: Added Terminal Face

G requested a terminal face for WWIII, like Jeeves has.

**Chose:** `◥‿◥` (Angular/Sharp style)

**Expressions:**
- neutral: `◥‿◥`
- happy: `◥▽◥`
- thinking: `◥~◥`
- determined: `◥‿◤`

**Created:**
- `wwiii-face.py` — Python script to display faces
- Added expressions table to CLAUDE.md
- Updated all file headers to include the face

Sharp, angular, masculine energy. Matches the vibe.
