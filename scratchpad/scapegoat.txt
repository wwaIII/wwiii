Guillaume de Machaut
and the Jews
GUILLAUME DE MAcHAUT was a French poet of the mid-fourteenth
century. His Judgment of the King of Navarre deserves to be better
known. The main part of the work is a long poem in the conventional,
courtly style, but its opening is striking. Guillaume claims that he par­
ticipated in a confusing series of catastrophic events before he finally
closeted himself in his house in terror to await death or the end of the
indescribable ordeal. Some of the events he describes are totally improb­
able, others only partially so. Yet the account leaves the impression that
something must actually have happened.
There are signs in the sky. People are knocked down by a rain of
stones. Entire cities are destroyed by lightning. Men die in great
numbers in the city where Guillaume lives (he doesn't tell us its name).
Some of these deaths are the result of the wickedness of the Jews and
their Christian accomplices. How did these people cause such huge
losses among the local population? They poisoned the rivers that
provided the drinking water. Heaven-sent justice righted these wrongs
by making the evildoers known to the population, who massacred them
all. People continued to die in ever greater numbers, however, until one
day in spring when Guillaume heard music in the street and men and
women laughing. All was over, and courtly poetry could begin again.
Modem criticism, since its origin in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, has not relied blindly on texts. Many scholars today believe
their critical insight develops in proportion to increasing skepticism.
'Thxts that were formerly thought to contain real information are now
suspect because they have been constantly reinterpreted by successive
generations of historians. On the other hand, epistemologists and

2

T H E S C APE G O A T

philosophers are experiencing an extreme crisis, which is undermining
what was once called historical science. Scholars who used to sustain
themselves on their texts now doubt the certainty of any interpretation.
At first glance, Guillaume de Machaut's text may seem susceptible
to the prevailing skepticism concerning historical certainty. But after
some moments' reflection even contemporary readers will find some real
events among the unlikely occurrences of the story. They will not be­
lieve in the signs in the sky or in the accusations against the Jews, but
neither will they treat all the unlikely themes in the same way, or put
them on the same level. Guillaume did not invent a single thing. He is
credulous, admittedly, and he reflects the hysteria of public opinion.
The innumerable deaths he tallys are nonetheless real, caused presuma­
bly by the famous Black Death, which ravaged the north of France
between 1349 and 1350. Similarly, the massacre of the Jews was real. In
the eyes of the massacrers the deed was justified by the rumors of
poisoning in circulation every where. The universal fear of disease gives
sufficient weight to the rumors to unleash the massacres described. The
following is the passage from the Judgment of the King of Navarre that
deals with the Jews:
After that came a false, treacherous and contemptible swine: this was shameful
Israel, the wicked and disloyal who hated good and loved everything evil, who
gave so much gold and silver and promises to Christians, who then poisoned
several rivers and fountains that had been clear and pure so that many lost their
lives; for whoever used them died suddenly. Certainly ten times one hundred
thousand died from it, in country and in city. Then finally this mortal calamity
was noticed.
He who sits on high and sees far, who governs and provides for everything,
did not want this treachery to remain hidden; he revealed it and made it so
generally known that they lost their lives and possessions. Then every Jew was
destroyed, some hanged, others burned; some were drowned, others beheaded
with an ax or sword. And many Christians died together with them in shame.1

Medieval communities were so afraid of the plague that the word
alone was enough to frighten them. They avoided mentioning it as long
as possible and even avoided taking the necessary precautions at the risk
of aggravating the effects ofthe epidemic. So helpless were they that tell­
ing the truth did not mean facing the situation but rather giving in to

its destructive consequences and relinquishing all semblance of normal
life. The entire population shared in this type of blindness. Their
desperate desire to deny the evidence contributed to their search for
"scapegoats:'2 La Fontaine, in Animals Sickened by the Plague, gives an
excellent description of this almost religious reluctance to articulate the
terrifYing term and thereby unleash some sort of evil power on the
community:
The plague (since it must be called by its name) .

La Fontaine introduces us to the process of collective bad faith
which recognizes the plague as a divine punishment. The angry god is
annoyed by a guilt that is not equally shared. To avert the plague the
guilty must be identified and punished or, rather, as La Fontaine writes,
"dedicated" to the god. The first to be interrogated in the fable are the
beasts of prey, who describe their bestial behavior, which is immediately
excused. Last comes the ass, the least bloodthirsty of them all, and
therefore the weakest and least protected. It is the ass that is finally
designated.
According to historians, in some cities Jews were massacred at the
mere mention of the plague being in the area, even before it had actually
arrived. Guillaume's account could fit this sort of phenomenon, because
the massacre occurred well before the height of the epidemic. But the
number of deaths the author attributes to the Jews' poisoning suggests
another explanation. If the deaths are real-and there is no reason to
think they are imagined-they might well be the first victims of that
same plague. But Guillaume does not think so even in retrospect. In his
eyes the traditional scapegoats remain the cause of the first stages of the

epidemic. Only in the later stages does the author recognize the presence
of a properly pathological phenomenon. Ultimately, the disaster is so
great that it casts doubt on the likelihood of a single explanation of a
conspiracy of poisoners, though Guillaume does not then reinterpret
the whole chain of events from a rational perspective.
In fact, we might well ask to what extent the poet recognizes the
existence of the plague, since he avoids writing the fatal word until the

very end. A t the climactic moment he solemnly introduces the Greek
word epydimie, which was uncommon at the time. The word obviously
does not function in his text in the same way as it would in ours; it is not
really a synonym for the dreaded word but rather a sort of euphemism,
a new way of not calling the plague by its name. It is in fact a new but
purely linguistic scapegoat. Guillaume tells us it was never possible to
determine the-nature and the cause of the disease from which so many
people died in such a short time:

Nor was there any physician or d octor who really knew the cause or origin, or
what it was (nor was there any remedy), yet this malady was so great that it was
called an epidemic .
On this score Guillaume prefers to refer to public opinion rather
than to think for himself. The word epydimie in the fourteenth century
had a certain scientific flavor which helped to ward off anxiety, some­
what like the vapors of the fumigation carried out at street corners to
reduce the waves of pestilence. A disease with a name seems on the way
to a cure, so uncontrollable phenomena are frequently renamed to create
the impression of control. Such verbal exorcisms continue to appeal
wherever science remains illusory or ineffective. By the refusal to name
it, the plague itself becomes "dedicated" to the god. This linguistic
sacrifice is innocent compared with the human sacrifices that accom­
pany or precede it, but its essential structure is the same.
Even in retrospect, all the real and imaginary collective scapegoats,
the Jews and the flagellants, the rain of stones and the epydimie, con­
tinue to play such an effective role in Guillaume's story that he never
perceives in them the single entity that we call the "Black Death:' The
author continues to see a number of more or less independent disasters,
linked only by their religious significance, similar in a way to the ten
plagues of Egypt.
Almost everything I have said so far is obvious. We all understand
Guillaume's text in the same way and my readers have no need of me.
It is not useless, however, to insist on this reading, of which the boldness
and forcefulness elude us, precisely because it is accepted by everyone
and is uncontroversial. There has been agreement about it literally for
centuries, all the more remarkable in that it involves a radical reinterpre­
tation. We reject without question the meaning the author gives his text.
We declare that he does not know what he is saying. From our several
centuries' distance we know better than he and can correct what he has

G U I L L A U M E D E MA C H A U T A N D T H E J E W S

written. We even believe that we have discovered a truth not seen by the
author and, with still greater audacity, do not hestitate to state that he
provides us with this truth even though he does not perceive it himself.
W hat is the source of our amazing confidence in the statement that
Jews were really massacred? An answer comes immediately to mind. We
are not reading this text in a vacuum. Other texts exist from the same
period; they deal with the same subjects; some of them are more val­
uable than Guillaume's. Their authors are less credulous. They provide
a tight framework ofhistorical knowledge in which Guillaume's text can
be placed. Thanks to this context, we can distinguish true from false in
the passage quoted.
It is true that the facts about the anti-Semitic persecutions during
the plague are quite well known. There is an already recognized body of
knowledge that arouses certain expectations in us. Guillaume's text is
responding to those expectations. This perspective is not wrong from the
point of view of our individual experience and our immediate contact
with the text, but it does not justifY us from the theoretical point of view.
Although the framework of historical knowledge does exist, it con­
sists of documents that are no more reliable than Guillaume's text, for
similar or different reasons. And we cannot place Guillaume exactly in
this context because we lack knowledge of where exactly the events he
describes took place. It may have been in Paris or Reims or even another
city. In any case the context is not significant; even without that infor­
mation the modern reader would end up with the reading I have given.
He would conclude that there were probably victims who were unjustly
massacred. He would therefore think the text is false, since it claims that
the victims were guilty, but true insofar as there really were victims. He
would, in the end, distinguish the truth from the false exactly as we do.
What gives us this ability? Would it not be wise to be guided systemati­
c;ally by the principle of discarding the whole basket of apples because
of the few rotten ones among them? Should we not suspect a certain
lapse of caution or remnant of naivete that, given the opportunity, will

be attacked by overzealous contemporary critics? Should we not admit
that all historical knowledge is uncertain and that nothing can be taken

from a text such as ours, not even the reality of a persecution?
All these questions must be answered categorically in the negative.
Out-and-out skepticism does not take into account the real nature of the
tnt. There is a particular relationship between the likely and the
unlikely characteristics of this text. In the beginning the reader cannot

6

T H E S C A P E G OAT

o f course distinguish between true and false. He sees only themes that
are incredible as well as others that are quite credible. He can believe in
the increasing number of deaths; it could be an epidemic. But the
massive scale of the poisonings described by Guillaume is scarcely
credible. There were no substances in the fourteenth century capable of
producing such harmful effects. The author's hatred for the supposedly
guilty people is explicit and makes his thesis extremely suspect.
These two types of characteristics cannot be recognized without at
least implicitly acknowledging that they interact with each other. If
there really is an epidemic, then it might well stir up latent prejudices.
The appetite for persecution readily focuses on religious minorities,
especially during a time of crisis. On the other hand a real persecution
might well be justified by the sort of accusation that Guillaume
credulously echoes. Such a poet is not expected to be particularly
sanguinary. If he believes in the stories he tells us, no doubt they are
believed by the people around him. The text suggests that public opin­
ion is overexcited and ready to accept the most absurd rumors. In short
it suggests a propitious climate for massacres which the author confirms
actually took place.
In a context of improbable events, those that are possible become
probable. The reverse is also true. In a context of probable events, the
unlikely ones cannot be ascribed to an imagination operating freely for
the pleasure of inventing fiction. We are aware of the imaginary ele­
ment, but it is the very specific imagination of people who crave vio­
lence. As a result, among the textual representations there is a mutual
confirmation. This correspondence can only be explained by one
hypothesis._The text we are reading has its roots in a real persecution
described from the perspective of the persecutors. The perspective is
inevitably deceptive since the persecutors are con�inced that their vio­
lence is justified; they consider themselves judges, and therefore they
must have guilty victims, yet their perspective is to some degree reliable,
for the certainty ofbeing right encourages them to hide nothing of their
massacres.
Faced with a text such as Guillaume de Machaut's, it is legitimate
to suspend the general rule by which the text as a whole is never worth
more, as far as real information goes, than the least reliable of its
features. If the text describes circumstances favorable to persecution, if
it presents us with victims of the type that persecutors usually choose,
and if, in addition, it represents these victims as guilty of the type of

G U I L L A U M E D E MA C H A U T A N D T H E J E W S

7

crimes which persecutors normally attribute to their victims, then it is
very likely that the persecution is real. If this reality is confirmed by the
text itself then there is little scope for doubt.
W hen one begins to understand the perspective of the persecutors,
the absurdity of their accusations strengthens rather than compromises
the informational value of the text, but only in reference to the violence
that it echoes. If Guillaume had added stories of ritual infanticide to the
episodes of poisoning, his account would be even more improbable
without, however, in the least diminishing the accuracy of the massacres
it reports. The more unlikely the accusations in this genre of text the
more they strengthen the probability of the massacres: they confirm for
us the psychosocial context within which the massacres must have taken
place. Conversely, if the theme of massacres is placed alongside the
theme of an epidemic it provides the historical context within which
even the most precise scholar could take this account of poisoning
seriously.
The accounts of persecutions are no doubt inaccurate, but in a way
they are so characteristic of persecutors in general, and of medieval
persecutors in particular, that the text can be believed in all the areas in
which conjectures are prompted by the very nature of the inaccuracy.
W hen potential persecutors describe the reality of their persecutions,

they should be believed.
The combination of the two types of characteristics generates
certainty. If the combination were only to be found in rare examples we
could not be so certain. But its frequency is too great to allow doubt.
Only actual persecution seen from the perspective of the persecutors
can explain the regular combination of these characteristics. Our
interpretation of all the texts is confirmed statistically.
The fact that certainty is statistically verifiable does not mean it is
based only on an accumulation of equally uncertain documents. All
documents like Guillaume de Machaut's are of considerable value be­
cause in them the probable and improbable interact in such a way that
each explains and justifies the presence of the other. If there is a statisti­

cal character to our certainty it is because any document studied in isola­
tion could be forged. This is unlikely, but not impossible, in the case of
a single document. And yet it is impossible where a great number of

documents are concerned.
The modem Western world chooses to interpret "texts of persecu­
tion" as real, this being the only possible way to demystify them. This

8

THE SCAPEGOAT

solution is accurate and perfect because it makes allowance for all the
characteristics found in this type of text. Solid' intellectual reasoning is
the basis, rather than humanitarianism or ideology. This interpretation
has not usurped the almost unanimous agreement granted it. For the
social historian reliable testimony, rather than the testimony of someone
who shares Guillaume de Machaut's illusions, will never be as valuable
as the unreliable testimony of persecutors, or their accomplic'es, which
reveals more because of its unconscious nature. The conclusive docu­
ment belongs to persecutors who are too naive to cover the traces of their
crimes, in contrast to modern persecutors who are too cautious to leave
behind documents that might be used against them.
I call those persecutors naive who are still convinced that they are
right and who are not so mistrustful as to cover up or censor the
fundamental characteristics of their persecution. Such characteristics
are either clearly apparent in the text and are directly revealing or they
remain hidden and reveal indirectly. They are all strong stereotypes and
the combination of both types, one obvious and one hidden, provides us
with information about the nature of these texts.
WEAREALLABLE today to recognize the stereotypes of persecution. But
what is now common knowledge scarcely existed in the fourteenth
century. Naive persecutors are unaware of what they are doing. Their con­
science is too good to deceive their readers systematically, and they pre­
sent things as they see them. They do not suspect that by writing their
accounts they are arming posterity against them. This is true of the infa­
mous "witch-hunts" of the sixteenth century. It is still true today in the
backward regions of the world. We are, then, dealing with the common­
place, and my readers may be bored by my insistence on these first obvi­
ous facts. The purpose will soon be seen. One slight displacement is
enough to transform what is taken for granted, in the case of Guillaume
de Machaut, into something unusual and even inconceivable.
My readers will have already observed that in speaking as I do I
contradict certain principles that numerous critics hold as sacrosanct. I
am always told one must never do violence to the text. Faced with Guil­
laume de Machaut the choice is clear: one must either do violence to the
text or let the text forever do violence to innocent victims. Certain prin­
ciples universally held to be valid in our day, because they seem to guard
against the excesses of certain interpretations, can bring about disas­
trous consequences never anticipated by those who, thinking they have

GUI L L AUM E D E M A C H AUT A N D T H E J E W S

9

foreseen everything, consider the principles inviolable. Everyone
believes that the first duty of the critic is to respect the meaning of texts.
Can this principle be sustained in the face of Guillaume de Machaut's
work?
Another contemporary notion suffers in the light of Guillaume de
Machaut's text, or rather from the unhesitating way we read it, and that
is the casual way in which literary critics dismiss what they call the
"referent?' In current linguistic jargon the referrent is the subject of the
text; in our example it is the massacre of the Jews, who were seen as
responsible for the poisoning of Christians. For some twenty years the
referent has been considered more or less inaccessible. It is unimpor­
tant! we hear, whether we are capable or not of reaching it; this naive
notion of the referent would seem only to hamper the latest study of
textuality. Now the only thing that matters is the ambiguous and
unreliable relationships of language. This perspective is not to be
rejected wholesale, but in applying it in a scholarly way we run the risk
that only Ernest Hoeppfuer, Guillaume's editor in the venerable Societe
des anciens textes, will be seen as the truly ideal critic of that writer. His
introduction does in fact speak of courtly poetry, but there is never any
mention of the massacre of the Jews during the plague.
The passage from Guillaume provides a good example of what I
have called in Des choses cachies depuis Ia fondation du monde "persecu­
tion texts?'4 By that I mean accounts of real violence, often collective,
told from the perspective of the persecutors, and therefore influenced by
characteristic distortions. These distortions must be identified and
corrected in order· to reveal the arbitrary nature of the violence that the
persecution text presents as justified.
We need not examine at length the accounts of witch trials to deter­
mine the presence of the same combination of real and imaginary,
though not gratuitous, details that we found in the text of Guillaume de
Machaut. Everything is presented as fact, but we do not believe all of it,
nor do we believe that everything is false. Generally we have no diffi­
culty in distinguishing fact from fiction. Again, the accusations made in
trials seem ridiculous, even though the witch may consider them true
and there may be reason to suspect her confession was not obtained by
torture. The accused may well believe herself to be a witch, and may

well have tried to harm her neighbors by magical proceedings. We still
do not consider that she deserves the death sentence. We do not believe
that magic is effective. We have no difficulty in accepting that the victim
shares her torturers' ridiculous belief in the efficacy of witchcraft but
this belief does not affect us; our skepticism is not shaken.
During the trial not a single voice is raised to reestablish or, rather,
to establish the truth. No one is capable of doing so. This means that not
only the judges and the witnesses but also the accused are not in agree­
ment with our interpretation of their own texts. This unanimity fails to
influence us. The authors of these documents were there and we were
not. We have access to no information that did not come from them.
And yet, several centuries later, one single historian or even the first
person to read the text feels he has the right to dispute the sentence
pronounced on the witches.s
Guillaume de Machaut is reinterpreted in the same extreme way,
the same audacity is exercised in overthrowing the text, the same
intellectual operation is in effect with the same certainty, based on the
same type of reasoning. The fact that some of the details are imagined
does not persuade us to consider the whole text imaginary. On the
contrary, the incredible accusations strengthen rather than diminish the
credibility of the other facts.
Once more we encounter what would seem to be, but is not, a para­
doxical relationship between the probable and improbable details that
enter into the text's composition. It is in the light of this relationship,
not yet articulated but no less apparent to us, that we will evaluate the
quantity and quality of the information that can be drawn from our text.
If the document is of a legal nature, the results are usually as positive or
even more positive than in the case of Guillaume de Machaut. It is
unfortunate that most of the accounts were burned with the witches.
The accusations are absurd and the sentence unjust, but the texts have
been edited with the care and clarity that generally characterize legal
documents. Our confidence is therefore well placed. There is no suspi­
cion that we secretly sympathize with those who conducted the witch­
hunts. The historian who would consider all the details of a trial equally

fantastic, on the excuse that some of them are tainted by the distortions
of the persecutors, is no expert, and his colleagues would not take him
seri ously. The most effective criticism does not consist in rejecting even
the believable data on the ground that it is better to sin by excess rather
than lack of distrust. Once again the principle of unlimited mistrust
must give way to the golden rule of persecution texts: the mind of a
persecutor creates a certain type of illusion and the traces ofhis illusion
confirm rather than invalidate the existence of a certain kind of event,
the persecution itself in which the witch is put to death. To distinguish
the true from the false is a simple matter, since each bears the clear mark
of a stereotype.
In order to understand the reasons behind this extraordinary assur­
ance evidenced in persecution texts, we must enumerate and describe
the stereotypes. This is also not a difficult task. It is merely a question
of articulating an understanding we already possess. We are not aware of
its scope because we never examine it in a systematic fashion. The
understanding in question remains captive in the concrete examples to
which we apply it, and these always belong to the mainly Western
historical domain. We have never yet tried to apply this understanding
beyond that domain, for example to the so-called ethnological universe.
To make this possible I am now going to sketch, in summary fashion, a
typology of the stereotypes of persecution.

C H A PTE R TW O

Stereotypes of Persecution
I SHALL CONFINE my discussion to collective persecutions and their
resonances. By collective persecutions I mean acts of violence commit­
ted directly by a mob of murderers such as the persecution of the Jews
during the Black Death. By collective resonances of persecutions I
mean acts of violence, such as witch-hunts, that are legal in form but
stimulated by the extremes of public opinion. The distinction is not,
however, essential. Political terrors, such as the French Revolution,
often belong to both types. The persecutions in which we are interested
generally take place in times of crisis, which weaken normal institutions
and favor mob formation. Such spontaneous gatherings of people can
exert a decisive influence on institutions that have been so weakened,
and even replace them entirely.
These phenomena are not always produced by identical circum­
stances. Sometimes the cause is external, such as an epidemic, a severe
drought, or a flood followed by famine. Sometimes the cause is
internal-political disturbances, for example, or religious conflicts.
Fortunately, we do not have to determine the actual cause. No matter
what circumstances trigger great collective persecutions, the experience
of those who live through them is the same. The strongest impression
is without question an extreme loss of social order evidenced by the dis­
appearance of the rules and "differences" that define cultural divisions.
Descriptions of these events are all alike. Some of them, especially
descriptions of the plague, are found in our greatest writers. We read
them

and

Sophocles,

Lucretius,

Boccaccio,

Shakespeare, Defoe, Thomas Mann, Antonin Artaud, and many others.

sions, and there i s never any great difference. We should not b e
sur prised since all the sources speak endlessly o f the absence of differ­
ence, the lack of cultural differentiation, and the confusion that results.
For example the Ponuguese monk Fco de Santa Maria writes in 1 697:
As soon as this violent and tem pestuous spark is lit in a kingdom or a republic,
magistrates are bewildered, people are terrified, the government thrown into
disarray. Laws are no longer obeyed; business comes to a halt; families l ose
coherence, and the streets their lively atmosphere. Everything is reduced to
extreme con fusion. Eve rything goes to ruin. For everything is touched and over­
whelmed by the weight and magnitude of such a horrible calamity. P eople
regardless of position or wealth are drowning in mortal sadness . . . . Th ose who
were burying others yesterday are themselves buried today . . . . No pity is
shown to friends since every sign of pity is dangerous .. . .
All the laws of love and nature are drowned or forgotten in the midst of the
horrors of such great con fusion; children are suddenly separated from their
parents, wives from their husbands, brothers and friends from each other . . . .
Men lose their natural courage and, not knowing any longer what advice to
follow, act like desperate blindmen, who encounter fear and contradictions at
every step. I

Institutional collapse obliterates or telescopes hierarchical and func­
tional differences, so that everything has the same monotonous and
monstrous aspect. The impression of difference in a society that is not
in a state of crisis is the result of real diversity and also of a system of
exchange that "differentiates" and therefore conceals the reciprocal
elements it contains by its very culture and by the nature of the
exchange. Marriages for example, or consumer goods, are not clearly
perceived as exchanges. When a society breaks down, time sequences
shonen. Not only is there an acceleration of the tempo of positive ex­
changes that continue only when absolutely indispensable, as in barter
for example, but also the hostile or "negative" exchanges tend to in­
crease. The reciprocity of negative rather than positive exchanges be­
comes foreshonened as it becomes more visible, as witnessed in the
reciprocity of insults, blows, revenge, and neurotic symptoms. That is
why traditional cultures shun a too immediate reciprocity.

the predominance of the same. Thus, paradoxically, it is both conflictual
and solipsistic. This lack of differentiation corresponds to the reality of
human relations, yet it remains mythic. In our own time we have had a
similar experience which has become absolute because it is projected on
the whole universe. The text quoted above highlights this process of
creating uniformity through reciprocity: "Those who were burying
others yesterday are themselves buried today ... .No pity is shown to
friends since every sign of pity is dangerous .. . children are suddenly
separated from their parents, wives from husbands, brother and friends
from each other?' The similarity of behavior creates confusion and a
universal lack of difference: "People regardless of position or wealth are
drowning in mortal sadness ....Everything is reduced to an extreme
confusion?'
The experience of great social crisis is scarcely affected by the diver­
sity of their true causes. The result is great uniformity in the descrip­
tions that relate to the uniformity itself. Guillaume de Machaut is no
exception.He sees in the egotistical withdrawal into the self and in the
series or reprisals that result-the paradox of reciprocal consequences­
one of the main causes of the pla�e.We can then speak of a stereotype
of crisis which is to be recognized, logically and chronologically, as the
first stereotype of persecution. Culture is somehow eclipsed as it be­
comes less differentiated. Once this is understood it is easier to under­
stand the coherence of the process of persecution and the sort of logic
that links all the stereotypes of which it is composed.
Men feel powerless when confronted with the eclipse of culture;
they are disconcerted by the immensity of the disaster but never look
into the natural causes; the concept that they might affect those causes
by learning more about them remains embryonic. Since cultural eclipse
is above all a social crisis, tJ::tere is a strong tendency to explain it by
social and, especially, moral causes.After all, human relations disinte­
grate in the process and the subjects of those relations cannot be utterly
innocent of this phenomenon. But, rather than blame themselves,
people inevitably blame either society as a whole, which costs them
nothing, or other people who seem particularly harmful for easily
identifiable reasons.The suspects are accused of a particular category of
crimes.
Certain accusations are so characteristic of collective persecution
that their very mention makes modern observers suspect violence in the

STEREOTYPES OF PERSECUTION

air. They look everywhere for other likely indications-other stereo­
types of persecution-to confirm their suspicion. At first sight the accu­
sations seem fairly diverse but their unity is easy to find. First there are
violent crimes which choose as object those people whom it is most
criminal to attack, either in the absolute sense or in reference to the indi­
vidual committing the act: a king, a father, the symbol of supreme
authority, and in biblical and modem societies the weakest and most
defenseless, especially young children. Then there are sexual crimes:
rape, incest, bestiality. The ones most frequently invoked transgress the
taboos that are considered the strictest in the society in question. Finally
there are religious crimes, such as profanation of the host. Here, too, it
is the strictest taboos that are transgressed.
All these crimes seem to be fundamental. They attack the very foun­
dation of cultural order, the family and the hierarchical differences with­
out which there would be no social order. In the sphere of individual
action they correspond to the global consequences of an epidemic of the
plague or of any comparable disaster.lt is not enough for the social bond
to be loosened; it must be totally destroyed.
Ultimately, the persecutors always convince themselves that a small
number of people, or even a single individual, despite his relative weak�
ness, is extrem�ly harmful to the whole of society. The stereotypical
accusation justifies and facilitates this belief by ostensibly acting the role
of mediator. It bridges the gap between the insignificance of the individ­
ual and the enormity of the social body. If the wrongdoers, even the dia­
bolical ones, are to succeed in destroying the community's distinctions,
they must either attack the community directly, by striking at its heart
or head, or else they must begin the destruction of difference within
their own sphere by committing contagious crimes such as parricide
and incest.
We need not take time to consider the ultimate causes of this belief,
such as the unconscious desires described by psychoanalysts, or the
Marxist concept of the secret will to oppress. There is no need to go that
far. Our concern is more elementary; we are only interested in the mech­
anism of the accusation and in the interaction between representation
and acts of persecution. They comprise a system, and, if knowledge of
the cause is necessary to the understanding of the system, then the most
im mediate and obvious causes will suffice. The terror inspired in people
by the eclipse of culture and the universal confusion of popular upris-

16

THE SCAPEGOAT

ings are signs of a community that is literally undifferentiated, deprived
of all that distinguishes one person from another in time and space.As
a result all are equally disordered in the same place and at the same time.
The crowd tends toward persecution since the natural causes of
what troubles it and transforms it into a turba cannot interest it. The
crowd by definition seeks action but cannot affect natural causes. It
therefore looks for an accessible cause that will appease its appetite for
violence. Those who make up the crowd are always potential persecu­
tors, for they dream of purging the community of the impure elements
that corrupt it, the traitors who undermine it. The crowd's act of becom­
ing a crowd is the same as the obscure call to assemble or mobilize, in
other words to become a mob. Actually this term comes from mobile,
which is as distinct from the word crowd as the Lltin turba is from
vulgus. The word mobilization reminds us of a military operation,
against an already identified enemy or one soon to be identified by the
mobilization of the crowd.
All the stereotypes of accusation were made against the Jews and
other scapegoats during the plague. But Guillaume de Machaut does
not mention them. As we have seen, he accuses the Jews of poisoning
the rivers. He dismisses the most improbable accusations, and his rela­
tive moderation can perhaps be explained by the fact that he is an
"intellectual:' His moderation may also have a more general significance
linked to intellectual development at the end of the Middle Ages.
During this period belief in occult forces diminished.Liter we shall
ask why.The search for people to blame continues but it demands more
rational crimes; it looks for a material, more substantial cause. This
seems to me to be the reason for the frequent references to poison. The
persecutors imagined such venomous concentrations of poison that
even very small quantities would suffice to annihilate entire popula­
tions. Henceforth the clearly lightweight quality of magic as a cause is
weighted down by materiality and therefore "scientific" logic. Chemis­
try takes over from purely demoniac influence.
The objective remains the same, however. The accusation of
poisoning makes it possible to lay the responsibility for real disasters on
people whose activities have not been really proven to be criminal.
Thanks !o poison, it is possible to be persuaded that a small group, or
even a single individual, can harm the whole society without being
discovered. Thus poison is both less mythical and just as mythical as

S T E R E O T Y P E S O F P E R S E C U TION

17

previous accusations or even the ordinary "evil eye" which is used to
attribute almost any evil to almost any person. We should therefore
recognize in the poisoning of drinking water a variation of a stereotypi­
cal accusation.The fact that these accusations are all juxtaposed in the
witch trials is proof that they all respond to the same need. The suspects
are always convicted of nocturnal participation in the famous sabbat. No
alibi is possible since the physical presence of the accused is not neces­
sary to establish proof . Participation in criminal assemblies can be
purely spiritual.
The crimes and their preparation with which the sabbat is
associated have a wealth of social repercussions. Among them can be
found the abominations traditionally attributed to the Jews in Christian
countries, and before them to the Christians in the Roman Empire.
They always include ritual infanticide, religious profanation, incestu­
ous relationships, and bestiality. Food poisoning as well as offenses
against influential or prestigious citizens always play a significant role.
Consequently, despite her personal insignificance, a witch is engaged in
activities that can potentially affect the whole of society. This explains
why the devil and his demons are not disdainful of such an alliance. I
will say no more about stereotypical accusations. It is easy to recognize
the crisis caused by the lack of differentiation as the second stereotype
and its link to the first.
I turn now to the third stereotype. The crowd's choice of victims
may be totally random; but it is not necessarily so. It is even possible that
the crimes of which they are accused are real, but that sometimes the
persecutors choose their victims because they belong to a class that is
particularly susceptible to persecution rather than because of the crimes
they have committed. The Jews are among those accused by Guillaume
de Machaut of poisoning the rivers. Of all the indications he gives us
this is for us the most valuable, the one that most reveals the distortion
of persecution. Within the context of other imaginary and real stereo­
types, we know that this stereotype must be real. In fact, in modern
Western society Jews have frequently been persecuted.
Ethnic and religious minorities tend to polarize the majorities
against themselves. In this we see one of the criteria by which victims
are selected, which, though relative to the individual society, is transcul­
tural in principle.There are very few societies that do not subject their
minorities, all the poorly integrated or merely distinct groups, to certain

18

THE SCAPEGOAT

forms of discrimination and even persecution. In India the Moslems are
persecuted, in Pakistan the Hindus. There are therefore universal signs
for the selection of victims, and they constitute our third stereotype.
In addition to cultural and religious there are purely physical
criteria. Sickness, madness, genetic deformities, accidental injuries, and
even disabilities in general tend to polarize persecutors. We need only
look around or within to understand the universality. Even today people
cannot control a momentary recoil from physical abnormality. The very
word abnormal, like the word plague in the Middle Ages, is something
of a taboo; it is both noble and cursed, sacer in all senses of the word. It
is considered more fitting in English to replace it with the word handi­
capped. The "handicapped" are subject to discriminatory measures that
make them victims, out of all proportion to the extent to which their
presence disturbs the ease of social exchange. One of the great qualities
of our society is that it now feels obliged to take measures for their benefit.
Disability belongs to a large group of banal signs of a victim, and
among certain groups- in a boarding school for example-every individ­
ual who has difficulty adapting, someone from another country or state,
an orphan, an only son, someone who is penniless, or even simply the
latest arrival, is more or less interchangeable with a cripple. If the disa­
bility or deformity is real, it tends to polarize "primitive" people against
the afflicted person. Similarly, if a group of people is used to choosing
its victims from a certain social, ethnic, or religious category, it tends to
attribute to them disabilities or deformities that would reinforce the
polarization against the victim, were they real. This tendency is clearly
observable in racist cartoons.
The abnormality need not only be physical In any area of existence
or behavior abnormality may function as the criterion for selecting
those to be persecuted. For example there is such a thing as social abnor­
mality; here the average defines the norm. The further one is from nor­
mal social status of whatever kind, the greater the risk of persecution.
This is easy to see in relation to those at the bottom of the social ladder.
This is less obvious when we add another marginal group to the
poor and outsiders- the marginal insider, the rich and powerful. The
monarch and his court are often reminiscent of the eye of the hurricane.
This double marginality is indicative of a social organization in turmoil.
In normal times the rich and powerful enjoy all sorts of protection and
privileges which the disinherited lack. We are concerned here not with
normal circumstances but with periods of crisis. A mere glance at world

S T E R E O T Y P E S O F P E R S E C UT I O N

19

history will reveal that the odds of a violent death at the hands of a fren­
zied crowd are statistically greater for the privileged than for any other
category. Extreme characteristics ultimately attract collective destruc­
tion at some time or other, extremes not just of wealth or poverty, but
also of success and failure, beauty and ugliness, vice and virtue, the abil­
ity to please and to displease. The weakness of women, children, and old
people, as well as the strength of the most powerful, becomes weakness
in the face of the crowd. Crowds commonly turn on those who origi­
nally held exceptional power over them.
No doubt some people will be shocked to find the rich and powerful
listed among the victims of collective persecution under the same title
as the poor and weak. The two phenomena are not symmetrical in their
eyes. The rich and powerful exert an influence over society which justi­
fies the acts of violence to which they are subjected in times of crisis.
This is the holy revolt of the oppressed.
The borderline between rational discrimination and arbitrary
persecution is sometimes difficult to trace. For political, moral, and
medical reasons certain forms of discrimination strike us as reasonable
today, yet they are similar to the ancient forms of persecution; for exam­
ple, the quarantine of anyone who might be contagious during an
epidemic.In the Middle Ages doctors were hostile to the idea that the
plague could spread through physical contact with the diseased. Gener­
ally, they belonged to the enlightened group and any theory of contagion
smacked too much of a persecutor's prejudice not to be suspect.And yet
these doctors were wrong. For the idea of contagion to become estab­
lished in the nineteenth century in a purely medical context, devoid of
any association with persecution, it was necessary for there to be no
suspicion that it was the return of prejudice in a new disguise.
This is an interesting question but has nothing to do with our
present work. My only goal is to enumerate the qualities that tend to
polarize violent crowds against those who possess them. The examples
I have given unquestionably belong in this category.The fact that some
of these acts of violence might even be justifiable today is not really
important to the line of analysis I am pursuing.
I am not seeking to set exact boundaries to the field of persecution;
nor am I trying to determine precisely where injustice begins or ends.
Contrary to what some think, I am not interested in defining what is
good and bad in the social and cultural order. My only concern is to
show that the pattern of collective violence crosses cultures and that its

20

THE SCAPEGOAT

broad contours are easily outlined. It is one thing to recognize the exist­
ence of this pattern, another to establish its relevance. In some cases this
is difficult to determine, but the proof! am looking for is not affected by
such difficulty. If a stereotype of persecution cannot be clearly recog­
nized in a particular detail of a specific event, the solution does not rest
only with this particular detail in an isolated context. We must deter­
mine whether or not the other stereotypes are present along with the de­
tail in question.
Let us look at two examples. Most historians consider that the
French monarchy bears some responsibility for the revolution in 1789.
Does Marie Antoinette's execution therefore lie outside our pattern?
The queen belongs to several familiar categories of victims of persecu­
tion; she is not only a queen but a foreigner. Her Austrian origin is men­
tioned repeatedly in the popular accusations against her. The court that
condemns her is heavily influenced by the Paris mob. Our first stereo­
type can also be found; all the characteristics of the great crisis that pro­
voke collective persecution are discernible in the French Revolution. To
be sure historians are not in the habit of dealing with the details of the
French Revolution as stereotypes of the one general pattern of persecu­
tion. I do not suggest that we should substitute this way of thinking in
all our ideas about the French Revolution. Nonetheless it sheds interest­
ing light on an accusation which is often passed over but which figures
explicitly in the queen's trial, that of having committed incest with her
son.2
Let's look at another example of a condemned person, someone who
has actually committed the deed that brings down on him the crowd's
violence: a black male who actually rapes a white female. The collective
violence is no longer arbitrary in the most obvious sense of the term. It
is actually sanctioning the deed it purports to sanction. Under such cir­
cumstances the distortions of persecution might be supposed to play no
role and the existence of the stereotypes of persecution might no longer
bear the significance I give it. Actually, these distortions of persecution
are present and are not incompatible with the literal truth of the accusa­
tion. The persecutors' portrayal of the situation is irrational. It inverts
the relationship between the global situation and the individual trans2. I am grateful to Jean-Claude Guillebaud for drawing my attention to this accusation
of incesL

gression.If there is a causal or motivational link between the two levels,
it can only move from the collective to the individual.The persecutor's
mentality moves in the reverse direction. Instead of seeing in the micro­
cosm a reflection or imitation of the global level, it seeks in the individ­
ual the origin and cause of all that is harmful.The responsibility of the
victims suffers the same fantastic exaggeration whether it is real or not.
As far as we are concerned there is very little difference between Marie
Antoinette's situation and that of the persecuted black male.
WE HAVE SEEN the close relationship that exists between the first two

stereotypes.In order to blame victims for the loss of distinctions result­
ing from the crisis, they are accused of crimes that eliminate distinc­
tions. But in actuality they are identified as victims for persecution
because they bear the signs of victims. What is the relationship of the
third type to the first two stereotypes? At first sight the signs of a victim
are purely differential. But cultural signs are equally so. There must
therefore be two ways of being different, two types of differences.
No culture exists within which everyone does not feel "different"
from others and does not consider such "differences" legitimate and
necessary.Far from being radical and progressive, the current glorifica­
tion of difference is merely the abstract expression of an outlook
common to all cultures. There exists in every individual a tendency to
think of himself not only as different from others but as extremely differ­
ent, because every culture entertains this feeling of difference among the
.ind viduals who compose it.
The signs that indicate a victim's selection result not from the
difference within the system but from the difference outside the system,
the potential for the system to differ from its own difference, in other
words not to be different at all, to cease to exist as a system.This is easily
seen in the case of physical disabilities. The human body is a system of
anatomic differences.If a disability, even as the result of an accident, is
disturbing, it is because it gives the impression of a disturbing dyna­
m sm.It seems to threaten the very system.Efforts to limit it are unsuc­
cessful; it disturbs the differences that surround it . These in tum
become monstrous, rush together, are compressed and blended together
to the point of destruction. Difference that exists outside the system is
terrifying because it reveals the truth of the system, its relativity, its
fragility, and its mortality.

22

THE SCAPEGOAT

The various kinds of victims seem predisposed to crimes that elimi­
nate differences. Religious, ethnic, or national minorities are never actu­
ally reproached for their difference, but for not being as different as
expected; and in the end for not differing at all. Foreigners are incapable
of respecting "real" differences; they are lacking in culture or in taste, as
the case may be. They have difficulty in perceiving exactly what is
different.The barbaros is not the person who speaks a different language
but the person who mixes the only truly significant distinctions, those
of the Greek language. In all the vocabulary of tribal or national
prejudices hatred is expressed, not for difference, but for its absence. It
is not the other nomos that is seen in the other, but anomaly, nor is it
another norm but abnormality; the disabled becomes deformed; the
foreigner becomes the apatride. It is not good to be a cosmopolitan in
Russia. Aliens imitate all the differences because they have none. The
mechanisms of our ancestors are reproduced unconsciously, from gener­
ation to generation, and, it is important to recognize, often at a less lethal
level than in the past. For instance today anti-Americanism pretends to
"differ'' from previous prejudices because it espouses all differences and
rejects the uniquely American virus of uniformity.
We hear everywhere that "difference" is persecuted. This is the
favorite statement of contemporary pluralism, and it can be somewhat
misleading in the present context.
Even in the most closed cultures men believe they are free and open
to the universal; their differential character makes the narrowest cul­
tural fields seem inexhaustible from within.Anything that compromises
this illusion terrifies us and stirs up the immemorial tendency to perse­
cution.This tendency always takes the same direction, it is embodied by
the same stereotypes and always responds to the same threat. Despite
what is said around us persecutors are never obsessed by difference but
rather by its unutterable contrary, the lack of difference.
Stereotypes of persecution cannot be dissociated, and remarkably
most languages do not dissociate them.This is true of Latin and Greek,
for example, and thus of French or English, which forces us constantly
in our study of stereotypes to turn to words that are related: crisis, crime,
criteria, critique, all share a common root in the Greek verb krino, which
means not only to judge, distinguish, differentiate, but also to accuse
and condemn a victim. Too much reliance should not be placed on ety­
mology, nor do I reason from that basis. But the phenomenon is so

S T E R E O T Y P E S 0 F P E R S E CU T I O N

23

con stant it deserves to be mentioned. It implies an as yet concealed rela­
tionship between collective persecutions and the culture as a whole. If
such a relationship exists, it has never been explained by any linguist,
philosopher, or politician.

CHAPTER THREE

What Is a Myth?
EACH TIME AN oral or written testament mentions an act of violence that
is directly or indirectly collective we question whether it includes the
description of a social and cultural crisis, that is, a generalized loss of
differences (the first stereotype), crimes that "eliminate differences" (the
second stereotype), and whether the identified authors of these crimes
possess the marks that suggest a victim, the paradoxical marks of the ab­
sence of difference (the third stereotype). The fourth stereotype is vio­
lence itself, which will be discussed later.
The juxtaposition of more than one stereotype within a single docu­
ment indicates persecution. Not all the stereotypes must be present:
three are enough and of ten even two. Their existence convinces us that
(I) the acts of violence are real; (2) the crisis is real; (3) the victims are
chosen not for the crimes they are accused of but for the victim's signs
that they bear, for everything that suggests their guilty relationship with
the crisis; and (4) the import of the operation is to lay the responsibility
for the crisis on the victims and to exert an influence on it by destroying
these victims or at least by banishing them from the community they
"pollute:'
If this pattern is universal it should be found in virtually all soci­
eties. Historians do in fact find it in all the societies included in their
studies which today embrace the entire planet, but previously were
confined to Western society and prior to that specifically to the Roman
Empire. And yet ethnologists have never come to recognize this pattern
of persecution in the societies they study. Why is that? Two answers are
possible. "Ethnological" societies are so little given to persecution that
the type of analysis applied to Guillaume de Machaut is not applicable

W HAT IS A M Y TH ?

25

to the m. Contemporary neoprimitivism which tends toward this solu­
tion places the superior humanity of all other cultures in opposition to
the inhumanity of our society. But no one dares argue that persecution
fails to exist in non-Western societies. The second possible answer is that
persecution exists but we do not recognize it, either because we are not

in possession of the necessary documents, or because we do not know how
1IJ decipher the documents we do possess.

I consider the second of these two hypotheses to be the correct one.
Mythical, ritualistic societies are not exempt from persecution. We pos­
sess documents that allow us to prove this: they contain the stereotypes
of persecution that I have named, they emerge from the same total pat­
tern as the treatment of the Jews in Guillaume de Machaut. If our logic

is consistent we should apply the same type of interpretation to them.
These documents are myths.
To make my task easier I shall begin with a myth that is exemplary.
It contains all the stereotypes of persecution and nothing else, and it
contains them in a startling form. It is Sophocles' account of the myth
of Oedipus in Oedipus Rex. I shall then tum to myths that reproduce the
pattern of persecution but in a form that is harder to decipher. Finally,
I shall turn to myths that reject this pattern but do so in such an obvious
way as to confirm its relevance. By proceeding from easy to more
difficult I intend to show that all myths must have their roots in real acts
of violence against real victims.
I begin with the myth of Oedipus. The plague is ravaging Thebes:
here we have the first stereotype of persecution. Oedipus is responsible
because he has killed his father and married his mother: here is the
second stereotype. The oracle declares that, in order to end the epi­
demic, the abominable criminal must be banished. The finality of
persecution is explicit . Parricide and incest serve openly as the inter­
mediaries between the individual and the collective; these crimes are so
oblivious of differences that their influence is contagious to the whole
society. In Sophocles' text we establish that to lack difference is to be
plague-stricken.
The third stereotype has to do with the signs of a victim. The first

is disability: Oedipus limps. This hero from another country arrived in
Thebes unknown to anyone, a stranger in fact ifnot in right. Finally, he

is the son of the king and a king himself, the legitimate heir of Laius.
Like many other mythical characters, Oedipus manages to combine the
marginality of the outsider with the marginality of the insider. Like

26

T H E S CAP EG0 AT

Ulysses at the end of the Odyssey he is sometimes a stranger and a beggar
and sometimes an all-powerful monarch.
The only detail without an equivalent in historical persecutions is
the exposed infant. But the whole world agrees that an exposed infant is
a victim at an early stage, chosen because of the signs of abnormality
which augur badly for his future and which evidently are the same as
the signs that indicate the selection of a victim mentioned above. The
fatal destiny determined for the exposed child is to be expelled by his
community. His escape is only ever temporary, his destiny is at the best
deferred, and the conclusion of the myth confirms the infallibility of the
signs of the oracle that dedicate him, from earliest infancy, to collective
violence.
The more signs of a victim an individual bears, the more likely he
is to attract disaster. Oedipus's infirmity, his past history of exposure as
an infant, his situation as a foreigner, newcomer, and king, all make him
a veritable conglomerate of victim's signs. We would not fail to observe
this if the myth were a historical document, and we would wonder at the
meaning of all these signs, together with other stereotypes of persecu­
tion. There would be no doubt about the answer. We would certainly see
in the myth what we see in Guillaume de Machaut's text, an account of
persecution told from the perspective of naive persecutors. The perse­
cutors portray their victim exactly as they see him- as the guilty
person - but they hide none of the objective traces of their persecution.
We conclude that there must be a real victim behind the text, chosen not
by virtue of the stereotypical crimes of which he is accused, crimes
which never spread the plague, but because of all the characteristics of
a victim specified in that text which are most likely to project on him the
paranoiac suspicion of a crowd tormented by the plague.
In the myth, as in Guillaume and in the witchcraft trials, the accu­
sations are truly mythological: parricide, incest, the moral or physical
poisoning of the community. These accusations are characteristic of the
way in which frenzied crowds conceive of their victims. But these same
accusations are juxtaposed with criteria for the selection of a victim
which may well be real. How can we not believe that a real victim lies
behind a text which presents him in this way and which makes us see
him, on the one hand, as the persecutors generally see him and, on the
other hand, as he should really be to be chosen by real persecutors. For
even greater certainty, his banishment is said to take place in a time of
extreme crisis which favors real persecution. All the conditions are pres-

W H A T IS A M Y T H ?

27

ent that will automatically prompt the modern reader, as we have
described above for historical texts, to reach the same interpretation we
would make of texts written from the perspective of persecutors. Why
do we hesitate in the case of myths?
Just as in medieval persecutions, stereotypical persecutors are
always found in myths and are statistically too prevalent to ignore. The
myths are too numerous for us to be able to attribute the repetition of the
model to anything but real persecutions. Any other conclusion would
be as absurd as to think that Guillaume de Machaut's account of the
Jews was pure fiction. As soon as we are confronted with a text that is
perceived to be historical we know that only the behavior of a persecu­
tor, seen through a persecutor's mind, can generate the collection of
stereotypes we find in many myths. Persecutors believe they choose
their victims because of the crimes they attribute to them, which make
them in their eyes responsible for the disasters to which they react by
persecution. Actually, the victims are determined by the criteria of
persecution that are faithfully reported to us, not because they want to
inform us but because they are unaware of what they reveal.
In the case of a text written by the persecutors the only elements of
it that should be believed are those that correspond (I) to the real cir­
cumstances of the texts coming into being, (2) to the characteristic traits
of its usual victims, and (3) to the results that normally follow collective
violence. If these authors describe not merely parricide and incest as the
cause of plagues but also everything that goes with this type ofbelief in
the real world and all the resulting sorts ofbehavior, then they are prob­
ably right on all these points because they are wrong about the first one .
.These are our four stereotypes of persecutors, the same combination of
the likely and the unlikely that we saw in the historical texts, and we can­
not expect it to have another significance than the one stated above. It
is the partly accurate and partly false perspective of persecutors who are
convinced of their own persecution.
This conclusion is not the result of naYvete. Real naivete is buried
under the extremes of skepticism, which is incapable of identifying the
stereotypes of persecution and of resorting to the daring yet legitimate
interpretation they require. The myth of Oedipus is not just a literary
text, or a psychoanalytic text, but a persecution text and should be inter­
preted as such. It will be objected that an interpretive method that was
invented in and for history cannot be applied to myth. I agree, but as I
have shown above, genuine historical evidence plays no more than a

28

T H E SCAPEGOAT

secondary role in deciphering representations of persecution. If they
had been dependent on history, they would never have been deciphered,
a process that has only just begun in the modem era.
If we consider that the victims mentioned by the witch-hunters are
real, we do not usually do so because we have information on them from
independent, unbiased sources. Admittedly, we place the text in a
framework of knowledge, but that framework would not exist if we
treated historical persecution texts as we treat the myth of Oedipus.
As already mentioned, we do not know exactly where the events
described by Guillaume de Machaut took place; even if we knew almost
nothing, including the existence of the Black Death, we would still con­
clude that such a text must reflect a phenomenon of real persecution.
Just the combination of persecutor stereotypes would give sufficient in­
dication. Why is the situation different in the case of myth?
My hypothesis relies on nothing historical in the critics' sense. It is
purely "structural" as in our interpretation of historical representations
of persecution. We assert that certain texts are based on a real persecu­
tion because of the nature and the disposition of the persecutor stereo­
types they portray. Without this origin it is impossible to explain why
and how the same themes keep recurring in the same pattern. If we
accept this thesis the obscurity of the text is immediately dispelled. The
themes are all easily explained and no serious objection can be raised.
For this reason we have unhesitatingly accepted the thesis as the origin
of all the historical texts that follow the pattern of persecution we have
described. As a result we no longer see it as controversial but as the pure
and simple truth of these texts. And we have good reason. It remains to
find out why such a solution does not occur to us in the case of a myth
like that of Oedipus.
That is the real problem. The lengthy analysis I have just given of
the type of interpretation that automatically results in the identification
of stereotypes of persecution was necessary in order to understand that
problem. As long as we are talking ofhistorical texts the interpretation
presents no problem, and there is no need to detail each step of the
process. But this attitude is precisely the obstacle to our taking the
necessary step backward to reflect on our understanding of the represen­
tations of persecution. We have not completely mastered that under­
standing because it has never been made totally explicit.
Everything I have said about mythology would appear to be obvious,
almost too obvious in the case of a "historical" document. If my readers

WHAT IS A MYTH?

29

are not convinced I shall convince them now by a very simple example.
I am going to draw a rough sketch of the story of Oedipus; I shall remove
his Greek clothing and substitute Western garb. In so doing, the myth
will descend several steps on the social ladder. I will give no details of
the place or the precise date ofthe event. The reader's good will will pro­
vide the rest. My tale falls naturally into some part of the Christian
world between the twelfth and thirteenth centuries; that is all that is
needed to release, like a spring, the operation that no one has thought
of applying to a myth, as long as we have been calling it precisely that,
a myth.
Harvests are bad, the cows give birth to dead calves; no one is on good terms
with anyone else. It is as if a spell had been cast on the village. Clearly, it is the
cripple who is the cause. He arrived one fine morning, no one knows from
where, and made himself at home. He even took the liberty of marrying the
most obvious heiress in the village and had two children by her. All sorts of
things seemed to take place in their house. The stranger was suspected of having
killed his wife's former husband, a sort of local potentate, who disappeared
under mysterious circumstances and was rather too quickly replaced by the
newcomer. One day the fellows in the village had had enough; they took their
pitchforks and forced the disturbing character to clear out.
No ONE WILL have the slightest hesitation in this instance. Everyone

will instinctively give the explanation I have mentioned. Everyone un­
derstands that the victim most certainly did not do what he was accused
ofbut that everything about him marked him as an outlet for the annoy­
ance and irritation of his fellow citizens. Everyone will understand
easily the relationship between the likely and unlikely elements in this
little story. No one will suggest that it is an innocent fable; no one will
lee it as a casual work of poetic imagination or of a wish to portray ''the
'fU
ndamental mechanisms of man's thought ?'
And yet nothing has changed. It has the same structure as the myth
Iince it is a rough sketch of it. Thus the interpretation does not rest on
.vhether it is or is not set in a framework of historical detail. A change
of setting is enough to redirect the interpreter to a reading that he indig­
nantly rejects when the text is presented in a "true" mythological form.
If we transported our story to the Polynesians or American Indians we
'I/Ould see the same ceremonious respect that the Hellenists had for the
Greek version of the myth, accompanied by the same obstinate refusal
to have recourse to the most effective interpretation. The latter is

30

THE SCAPEG0AT

reserved exclusively for our historical universe, for reasons we shall try
to uncover later.
We are dealing with cultural schizophrenia. My hypothesis would
have served a purpose if it had only revealed just that. We interpret texts
not by what they really are but by their external trappings (I am almost
tempted to call it their commercial wrapping). A slight modification of
the presentation of a text is enough to inhibit or release the only truly
radical demystification available to us, and no one is aware of the
situation.
So FAR I have only spoken of a myth that I myself recognize to be exem­
plary in regard to representations of persecution. Those myths that are
not must also be discussed. They do not bear an obvious resemblance to
persecution texts, but if we look for the four stereotypes we shall find
plenty of them without difficulty, though in a rather more transfigured
form.
Often the beginning of the myth can be reduced to a single charac­
teristic. Day and night are confused; heaven and earth communicate;
gods move among men and men- among gods. Among god, man, and
beast there is little distinction. Sun and moon are twins; they fight
constantly and cannot be distinguished one from the other. The sun
moves too close to the earth; drought and heat make life unbearable. At
first sight, there is nothing in these beginnings of myth that has any con­
nection with reality. Clearly, however, myth involves a lack of differenti­
ation. The great social crises that engender collective persecutions are
experienced as a lack of differentiation. This is the characteristic that I
uncovered in the preceding chapter. We might well ask whether this is
not our first stereotype of persecution, in an extremely stylized and
transfigured form, reduced to its simplest expression.
Lack of differentiation in myth sometimes has idyllic connotations,
of which I will speak later. Usually, its character is catastrophic. The
confusion of day and night signifies the absence of sun and the wither­
ing of everything. The sun's too close proximity to the earth indicates
that existence is equally unbearable but for the opposite reason. Myths
that are thought to "invent death" in reality invent nothing but rather
distinguish it from life when "in the beginning'' both are confused. I
believe this to mean that it is impossible to live without dying or, once
again, that existence is unbearable.
"Primordial" lack of differentiation and the "original" chaos conflict

W H A T IS A M Y T H ?

31

strongly in character. Those elements that are indistinguishable often
have conflictual connotations. This theme is particularly developed in
the post-Vedic texts ofBrahman India. Everything always begins with an
interminable, indecisive battle between gods and demons who are so
alike one can hardly tell them apart. In short, that too rapid and visible
evil reciprocity makes all behavior the same in the great crises of society
that are apt to trigger collective persecutions. The undifferentiated is
only a partially mythical translation of this state of affairs. We must
associate with it the theme of twins or fraternal enemies who illustrate
the conflict between those who become undifferentiated in a particu­
larly graphic fashion. No doubt this is why the theme provides the most
classic beginning for myths everywhere.
Levi-Strauss was the first to identify the unity of numerous mythi­
cal beginnings in terms of a lack of differentiation. For him the un­
differentiated is purely rhetorical; it serves as a background for the
display of differences. There is no question of relating this, then, to real
social conditions. And until now there would seem to be no evidence of
any hope of finding in myth any concrete relationship with reality. Our
four stereotypes of persecution have now modified this state of affairs. If
we find three of them in the myths which begin in the way I have
described, we might legitimately conclude that the initial lack of
differentiation constitutes a schematic but nevertheless recognizable
version of the first.
We need not dwell on this. All the crimes that persecutors attribute
to their victims can generally be found in myths. In certain, especially
Greek, mythologies these crimes are often not treated as crimes; they are
seen as mere pranks; they are excused and made light of but they are
nevertheless present and, at least in letter if not in spirit, they cor­
respond perfectly to our stereotype. In the myths that appear most
"primitive'!... if I dare use the term -the chief characters are formi­
dable criminals and are treated as such. Because of this they incur a
punishment that bears a strange resemblance to the fate of the victims
of collective persecutions (it is often a question of lynching). On this
one main point the myths which I call "primitive" are even closer than
the myth of Oedipus to the crowd phenomena with which I am compar­
ing them.
There is only one stereotype we must find in these myths: the mark
that identifies the selection of a victim for persecution. I need not point
out that world mythology swarms with the lame, the blind, and the crip-

32

TH E SCAPE G0AT

pled or abounds with people stricken by the plague. As well as the
heroes in disgrace there are those who are exceptionally beautiful and
free of all blemish. This means not that mythology literally is meaning­
less but that it usually deals in extremes; and we have already noted that
this is a characteristic of the polarization of persecution.
The whole range of victim signs can be found in myths, a fact
unnoticed because we focus on the victim's ethnic or religious minority.
That panicular sign cannot appear in the same form in mythology. We
find neither persecuted Jews nor blacks. But their equivalent can be
found in a theme that plays a central role in all pans of the world, that
of the foreigner banished or assassinated by the community. 1
The victim is a person who comes from elsewhere, a well-known
stranger. He is invited to a feast which ends with his lynching. Why? He
has done something he should not have done; his behavior is perceived
as fatal; one of his gestures was misinterpreted. Here again we have only
to imagine a real victim, a real stranger, and everything becomes clear.
If the stranger behaves in a strange or insulting way in the eyes of his
hosts, it is because he conforms to other customs. Beyond a cenain
threshold of ethnocentrism, the stranger becomes, for better or worse,
truly mythological. The smallest misunderstanding can be disastrous.
Beneath this myth of an assassinated stranger who is made a god we can
trace a form of"provincialism" so extreme that we can no longer identify
it, just as we no longer can see the sounds and colors of an electromag­
netic wave beyond a cenain length. Again, to bring our overphilosophi­
cal interpretations down to eanh, we need only place these mythical
themes against a Western, rural background. One immediately grasps
the meaning, just as in the transposition of the Oedipus myth a moment
ago. A little suitable intellectual gymnastics, and especially a little less
icy veneration for all that does not belong to the modern Western world,
and we will quickly learn how to enlarge our field of recognition and
understanding in mythology.
A close examination of myths is not necessary to establish that a
great number of them contain our four stereotypes of persecution; there
are others, of course, that contain only three, two, one or even none. I
do not overlook them but am not yet able to analyze them successfully.

We are beginning to see that the representations of persecution we have
already deciphered are for us an Ariadne's thread to guide us through the
labyrinth of mythology. They will enable us to trace the real origin in
collective violence of even the myths that contain no stereotypes of
persecution. We shall see later that, instead of gainsaying our thesis or
demanding questionable feats to maintain it, those myths that are
entirely void of stereotypes of persecution will provide us with the most
astounding verification. For the time being we must continue our analy­
sis of the myths that contain our stereotypes but under a form that is less
easy to identify, because it is somewhat more transfigured, than in the
medieval persecutions or the myth of Oedipus. This more extreme
transfiguration does not create an insurpassable abyss between myths
and persecutions that have already been deciphered. One word is
sufficient to define the type to which they belong: monstrous.
Ever since the romantic movement we have tended to see in the
mythological monster a true creation ex nihilo, a pure invention. Imagi­
nation is perceived as an absolute ability to conceive of forms that exist
nowhere in nature. Examination of mythological monsters reveals no
such thing. They always consist of a combination of elements borrowed
from various existing forms and brought together in the monster, which
then claim an independent identity. Thus the Minotaur is a mixture of
man and bull. Dionysus equally, but the god in him commands more
attention than the monster or than the mixture of forms.
We must think of the monstrous as beginning with the lack of
differentiation, with a process that, though it has no effect on reality,
does affect the perception of it. As the rate of conftictual reciprocity
accelerates, it not only gives the accurate impression ofidentical behavior
among the antagonists but it also disintegrates perception, as it becomes
dizzying. Monsters are surely the result of a fragmentation of perception
and of a decomposition followed by a recombination that does not take
natural specificity into account. A monster is an unstable hallucination
that, in retrospect, crystallizes into stable forms, owing to the fact that
it is remembered in a world that has regained stability.
We saw earlier that the representations of historical persecutions
resemble mythology. A transition to the monstrous is made in the
extreme representations we have mentioned, such as in the crisis caused
by the lack of differentiation, or in signs like deformity that mark a
Victim for persecution. There comes a point at which physical mon-

34

THE SCAPEGOAT

strosity and moral monstrosity merge. The crime of bestiality, for exam­
ple, engenders monstrous mixtures of men and animals; in the
hermaphroditism of a Tiresias, physical monstrosity cannot be distin­
guished from moral monstrosity. The stereotypes themselves merge, in
other words, to form the mythological monsters.
In the mythological monster the "physical" and the "moral" are
inseparable. The two are so perfectly combined that any attempt to sep­
arate them seems doomed to failure. Yet, ifl am right, there is a distinc­
tion to be made. Physical deformity must correspond to a real human
characteristic, a real infirmity. Oedipus's wounds or Vulcan's limp are
not necessarily less real in theirorigins than the characteristics of medie­
val witches. Moral monstrosity, by contrast, actualizes the tendency of
all persecutors to project the monstrous results of some calamity or
public or private misfortune onto some poor unfortunate who, by being
infirm or a foreigner, suggests a certain affinity to the monstrous.
My analysis may seem strange, for the monstrous character is gener­
ally perceived as being the final proof of the absolutely fictitious and im­
aginary character of mythology. Yet in the monster we recognize the
false certainty and the true possibility that I have been discussing. It
will be said that the presence of stereotypes in such confusion discounts
my argument. If they are examined all at once, however, they do form a
sort of unity; they create a particular climate that is specific to mythol­
ogy, and we should do nothing to dissociate the elements even for
aesthetic reasons. Nor have our best interpreters ever separated them,
though some scholars are moving in the direction of a definitive separa­
tion of the (imaginary) crimes of the victims and the (possibly real) signs
that indicate a victim. Here is a representative text, ofMircea Eliade's on
Greek mythology, that begins with the latter and ends with the former:
[the heroes] are distinguished by their strength and beauty but also by monstrous
characteristics ([gigantic] stature - Herades, Achilles, Orestes, Pelops-but also
stature [much shorter] than the average); or they are [theriomorphic] (Lycaon,
the "wolf") or able to change themselves into animals. They are androgynous
(Cecrops), or change their sex (Teiresias), or dress like women (Heracles). In addi­
tion, the heroes are characterized by numerous anomalies (acepha/y or poly­
cephaly; Heracles has three rows of teeth); they are apt to be lame, one-eyed or
blind. Heroes often fall victim to insanity (Orestes, Bellerophon, even the excep·
tiona! Heracles, when he slaughtered his sons by Megara). As for their sexual
behavior, it is exassive or aberrant: Heracles impregnates the fifty daughters of
Thespius in one night; Theseus is famous for his numerous rapes (Helen, Ariadne,

WHAT IS A MYTH?

35

etc.); Achilles ravishes Stratonice. The heroes commit incest with their daughters
or their mothers and indulge in massacres from envy or anger or often for no
reason at all: they even slaughter their fathers and mothers or their relatives. 2

This text is imponant because it contains so many relevant traits.
Under the sign of the monstrous the author unites the marks that iden­
tify a victim and the stereotypical crimes without mixing them. Some­
thing here seems to resist conflating the two rubrics. There is an actual,
though not justified, separation.
Physical and moral monstrosity go together in mythology. Their
connection seems normal, and is even suggested by language. But in a
similar situation in our historical universe we would not exclude the
possibility of the victims being real, making the perpetual juxtaposition
ofthe two kinds of monstrosity odious; we would suspect that its origin
lay in the mentality of persecution. But what else could be its source?
What other force might always be responsible for converging the two
themes? For reassurance it is attributed to the imagination. We always
rely on the imagination in order to avoid reality. Yet I'm not referring to
the imagination of the aesthetic ian but, rather, to that of Guillaume de
Machaut's at its most confused, to the son of imagination, which, pre­
cisely because it is confused, brings us back to the real victims. It is
always the imagination of the persecutors. Physical and moral mon­
strosity are heaped together in myths that justify the persecution of the
infirm. The fact that other stereotypes of persecution surround them
leaves no room for doubt. If this were a rare conjunction it might be
dubious, but innumerable examples can be found; it is the daily fare of
mythology.
Except in the case of cenain exemplary myths, that of Oedipus in
panicular, mythology cannot be directly assimilated to the pattern of
representations of persecution that can be decoded, but it can be so in­
directly. Instead of bearing certain faintly monstrous characteristics, the
victim is hard to recognize as a victim because he is totally monstrous.
This difference should not lead us to decide that the two types of texts
cannot have a common source.
After detailed examination it becomes clear that we are dealing with
a single principle of distoned presentation, though in mythology the
mechanism operates in a higher register than in history. It is undeniably

1978), 1 :288 (italics mine).

36

THE SCAPEGOAT

and universally true that the less rational the persecutors' conviction the
more formidable that conviction becomes. But in historical persecu­
tions the conviction is not so overwhelming as to conceal its character
and the process of accusation from which it stems. Admittedly, the
victim is condemned in advance; he cannot defend himself, his trial has
already taken place, but at least there is a trial no matter how prejudiced.
The witches are hunted legally; even the persecuted Jews are explicitly
charged, charged with crimes that are less unlikely than those of the
mythical heroes. The desire for relative probability which conjures up
"the poisoning of rivers;• paradoxically helps us to make the distinction
between truth and falsity. Mythology demands the same operation,
though in a more daring form because the circumstances are more
confused.
In historical persecutions the "guilty" remain sufficiently distinct
from their "crimes" for there to be no mistake about the nature of the
process. The same cannot be said of myth. The guilty person is so much
a part of his offense that one is indistinguishable from the other. His
offense seems to be a fantastic essence or ontological attribute. In many
myths the wretched person's presence is enough to contaminate every­
thing around him, infecting men and beasts with the plague, ruining
crops, poisoning food, causing game to disappear, and sowing discord
around him. Everything shrivels under his feet and the grass does not
grow again. He produces disasters as easily as a fig tree produces figs. He
need only be himself.
The definition ofvictim as sinner or criminal is so absolute in myth,
and the causal relationship between crime and collective crisis is so
strong, that even perceptive scholars have as yet failed to disassociate
these details and to identify the accusatory process. The persecution
text, whether medieval or modem, provides the needed Ariadne's
thread. Even those historical texts that retain the strongest sense of
persecution reflect only very slight conviction. The more relentlessly
they struggle to demonstrate the justice of their wrongdoing, the less
convincing they sound. Ifthe myth were to state "Undoubtedly Oedipus
killed his father; it is certain that he had intercourse with his mother,"
we would recognize the type of lie it embodies; it would be written in
the style of historical persecutors, from a basis of belief. But it speaks
tranquilly of an unquestionable fact: ''Oedipus killed his father; he had
intercourse with his mother," in the same tone one would say: ''Night
follows day'' or "The sun rises in the East."

The distortions in persecution become weaker as we move from
myths to persecutions in the Western world. This weakening has in fact
allowed us to decipher the latter. Our task is to use this decoding in
order to gain access to mythology. I will use as my guide the text of Guil­
laume de Machaut and the others we have already encountered because
they are easier to read, to help interpret the myth of Oedipus, first of all,
and then increasingly more difficult texts. As we proceed we will recog­
nize all the stereotypes of persecution and so reach the conclusion that
there are real acts of violence and real victims behind themes that seem
so fantastic that it is difficult to think that one day we may no longer con­
sider them purely and simply imaginary.
Our medieval ancestors took the most incredible fables seriously­
the poisoning of fOuntains by the Jews or by lepers, ritual infanticide,
witches' broomsticks, and moonlight diabolical orgies. The mixture of
cruelty and credulity seems insurpassable to us. And yet myths surpass
them; historical persecutions are the result of degraded superstitions.
We think we are free of mythical illusions because we have sworn not to
be hoodwinked by them.
We are in the habit of considering necessarily fictional even the
most plausible characteristics of mythological heroes because of their
association with other improbable characteristics. Similarly, if we were
to permit it, the same false notion of prudence and the same attitude
toward fiction would prevent us from recognizing the reality of the anti­
Semitic massacres in Guillaume de Machaut. We do not doubt the real­
ity of the massacres on the excuse that they are juxtaposed with all sorts
of more or less significant fables. There is equally no good reason to
doubt the reality in the case of myths.
The face of the victim shows through the mask in the texts ofhistor­
ical persecutions. There are chinks and cracks. In mythology the mask
is still intact; it covers the whole face so well that we have no idea it is
a mask. We think there is no one behind it, neither victim nor perse­
cutor. We are somewhat like Polyphemus's brothers, the Cyclopes, to
whom he calls in vain for bel p after Ulysses and his companions blinded
him. We save our only eye, if we have one, for what we call history. As
for our ears, if we have them, they only hear this no one, no one . . that
is so deeply embedded in collective violence that we take it for nothing,
nonexistent, pure fabrication by a Polyphemus in a vein of poetic
improvisation.
We no longer consider mythological monsters as a supernatural or
.

38

THE SCAPEGOAT

even natural species; there are no longer theological or even zoological
genres. They belong instead to the quasi-genres of the imaginary,
"archetypes" of fable heaped in an unconsciousness that is even more
mythical than the myths themselves. There was a time when no one
could read even the distortions of persecution found in our own history.
Finally we did learn. We can put a date to this achievement. It goes back
to the beginning of the modem era and seems to constitute only the first
stage in a process that has never really been interrupted but has been
marking time for centuries because it lacked a truly fruitful direction
that would stretch back to mythology.
Now WE MUST discuss an essential dimension of myth that is almost
entirely absent from historical persecutions: that of the sacred. Medie­
val and modern persecutors do not worship their victims, they only hate
them. They are therefore easy to identify as victims. It is more difficult
to spot the victim in a supernatural being who is a cult object. Admit­
tedly, the glorious adventures of the hero can hardly be distinguished
from the stereotypical crimes of collective victims. Like those victims,
moreover, the hero is hunted and even assassinated by his own people.
But the experts are in agreement that such annoying incidents are not
important. They are merely minor escapades in a career that is so noble
and transcendental it is poor taste to notice them.
Myths exude the sacred and do not seem comparable with texts that
do not. No matter how striking the similarities mentioned in the preced­
ing pages they pale before this dissimilarity. I am trying to explain
myths by discovering in them more extreme distortions of persecution
than those of historical persecutors as they recall their own persecu­
tions. The method has been successful until now since I have uncovered
in myths the warped forms of everything that appears equally in perse­
cution texts. We may wonder whether we are missing the essential. Even
if on a lower level mythology is vulnerable to my comparative method,
idealists will say that at a higher level it escapes through the transcen­
dental dimension that is beyond reach.
This is not so for the following two reasons. Beginning with the
similarities and differences between our two types of texts, the nature of
the sacred and the necessity of its presence in myths can literally be
deduced by a simple process of reasoning. I will go back to the persecu­
tion texts and show that, despite appearances, they contain traces of the
sacred that correspond exactly to what is to be expected, if we were to

WHAT IS A MYTH I

39

recognize, as I did earlier, the degenerated and half-decomposed myths
in these texts.
In order to understand that existence of the sacred, we must begin
by recognizing a true belief in what I have called the stereotype of accu­
sation, the guilt and the apparent responsibility of the victims. Guil­
laume de Machaut sincerely believed that the rivers were poisoned by
the Jews. Jean Bodin sincerely believed that France was exposed to
danger by sorcery in his day.We do not have to sympathize with the be­
lief by admitting its sincerity.Jean Bodin was an intelligent man and yet
he believed in sorcery.Two centuries later such a belief makes people of
even mediocre intelligence laugh. What, then, is the source of the illu­
sions of a Jean Bodin or a Guillaume de Machaut? Clearly, they are
social in nature. They are illusions shared by a great number of people.
In most societies belief in witchcraft is not the act of certain individuals
only, or even of many, but the act of everyone.
Magical beliefs flourish amid a certain social consensus. Even
though it was far from unanimous in the sixteenth and even in the four­
teenth century, the consensus was broad, at least in certain milieus. It
acted as a sort of constraint on people. The exceptions were not
numerous, and they were not influential enough to prevent the persecu­
tions. The representation of these persecutions retains certain charac­
teristics of a collective representation in the sense used by Durkheim.
We have examined the makeup of this belief. Vast social groups found
themselves at the mercy of terrifying plagues such as the Black Death or
sometimes less visible problems.Thanks to the mechanism of persecu­
tion, collective anguish and frustration found vicarious appeasement in
the victims who easily found themselves united in opposition to them by
virtue of being poorly integrated minorities.
We owe our comprehension of this to the discovery of stereotypes of
persecution in a text. Once we understand we almost always exclaim:
The victim is a scapegoat. Everyone has a clear understanding of this ex­
pression; no one has any hesitation about its meaning. Scapegoat indi­
cates both the innocence of the victims, the collective polarization in
opposition to them, and the collective end result of that polarization.
The persecutors are caught up in the "logic" of the representation of
per secution from a persecutor's standpoint, and they cannot break away.
Guillaume de Machaut no doubt never participated himself in collec­
tive acts of violence, but he adopts the representation of persecution
that feeds the violence and is fed in return. He shares in the collective

40

THE SCAPEGOAT

effect of the scapegoat. The polarization exerts such a constraint on
those polarized that the victims cannot prove their innocence.
We use the word "scapegoat" therefore to summarize all that I have
said so far on collective persecutions. By mentioning "scapegoat" when
discussing Guillaume de Machaut we indicate that we are not taken in
by his representation and that we have done what is necessary to break
down the system and substitute our own reading. "Scapegoat"
epitomizes the type of interpretation I would like to extend to mythology.
Unfortunately, the expression and the interpretation suffer the same
fate. Because everyone uses it no one bothers to determine its exact sig­
nificance, and the misconceptions multiply. In the example of Guil­
laume de Machaut and persecution texts in general, this use has no
direct connection with the rite of the scapegoat as described in Leviti·
cus, or with other rites that are sometimes described as belonging to the
"scapegoat" because they more or less resemble that of Leviticus.
As soon as we begin to study the "scapegoat" or think about the
expression apart from the context of the persecutor, we tend to modify
its meaning. We are reminded of the rite; we think of a religious
ceremony that unfolds on a fixed date and is performed by priests; we
imagine a deliberate manipulation. We think of skillful strategists who
are fully aware of the mechanisms of victimization and who knowingly
sacrifice innocent victims in full awareness of the cause with Machiavel·
lian ease.
Such things can happen, especially in our time, but they cannot
happen, even today, without the availability of an eminently manipula·
ble mass to be used by the manipulators for their evil purposes, people
who will allow themselves to be trapped in the persecutors' representa­
tion of persecution, people capable ofbeliefwhere the scapegoat is con·
cerned. Guillaume de Machaut is obviously no manipulator. He is not
intelligent enough. If manipulation exists in his universe, he must be
numbered among the manipulated. The details that are so revealing in
his text are not revealing for him, evidently, but only for those who
understand their real significance. Earlier I spoke of naive persecutors;
I could have spoken of their lack of awareness.
Too conscious and calculating an awareness of all that the "scape·
goat" connotes in modem usage eliminates the essential point that the
persecutors believe in the guilt of their victim; they are imprisoned in
the illusion of persecution that is no simple idea but a full system of
representation. Imprisonment in this system allows us to speak of an

W H AT I S A M Y T H ?

41

unconscious persecutor, and the proof of his existence lies in the fact
that those in our day who are the most proficient in discovering other
people's scapegoats, and God knows we are past masters at this, are
never able to recognize their own. Almost no one is aware of his own
shortcoming. We must question ourselves if we are to understand the
enormity of the mystery. Each person must ask what his relationship is
to the scapegoat. I am not aware of my own, and I am persuaded that the
same holds true for my readers. We only have legitimate enmities. And
yet the entire universe swarms with scapegoats. The illusion of persecu­
tion is as rampant as ever, less tragically but more cunningly than under
Guillaume de Machaut. Hypocite lecteur, mon semblable, mon frere . . .
If we are at the point where we compete in the penetrating and sub­
tle discovery of scapegoats, both individual and collective, where was the
fuurteenth century? No one decoded the representation of persecution as
we do today. "Scapegoat" had not yet taken on the meaning we give it to­
day. The concept that crowds, or even entire societies, can imprison
themselves in their own illusions ofvictimage was inconceivable. Had we
tried to explain it to the men of the Middle Ages, they would not have un­
derstood. Guillaume de Machaut was much more influenced by the
scapegoat effect than we are. His universe was more deeply immersed in
its unawareness of persecution than we are, but even so, it was less so
than the world ofmythology. In Guillaume, as we have seen, just a small
portion, and not the worst, of the Black Death is blamed on scapegoats:
in the myth of Oedipus it is the entire plague. In order to explain epi­
demics, mythological universes have never needed anything more than
stereotypical crimes and of course those who are guilty of them. Proof
can be found in ethnological documents. Ethnologists are shocked by
my blasphemies yet for a long time they have had at their disposal the
necessary evidence to confirm them. In so<alled ethnological societies
the presence of an epidemic immediately rouses the suspicion that there
has been an infraction of the basic rules of the community. We are not
permitted to call such societies primitive, yet we are expected to describe
as primitive everything that perpetuates the mythological type ofbeliefs
and behaviors that belong to persecution in our universe.
The representation of persecution is more forceful in myths than in
historical accounts and we are disconcerted by that strength. Compared
with such granitelike belief ours seems paltry. The representations of
persecution in our history are always vacillating and residual, which is
why they are so quickly demystified, at least within several centuries,

42

THE SCAPEGOAT

instead of lasting for millennia, like the myth of Oedipus, which toys
with our effons to understand it. Such formidable belief is foreign to us
today. At best we can try to imagine it by tracing it in the texts. We are
led, then, to the determination that the sacred forms a pan of that blind
and massive belief.
Let us examine this phenomenon, beginning with the conditions
that make it possible. We do not know why this belief is so strong, but
we suspect that it corresponds to a more effective scapegoat mechanism
than our own, to a system of persecution that functions at a higher level
than our own. To judge by the numerical preponderance of mythologi­
cal universes, this higher system is more the norm for humanity than
our own society which constitutes the exception. Such a strong belief
could not be established and perpetuated, after the death of the victim,
in the persecutors' commemoration in their myths, if there were any
doubt left in the relationships at the hean of the community, in other
words if there were not total reconciliation. In order for all the persecu­
tors to be inspired by the same faith in the evil power of their victim, the
laner must successfully polarize all the suspicions, tensions, and
reprisals that poisoned those relationships. The community must effec­
tively be emptied of its poisons. It must feel liberated and reconciled
within itself. This is implied in the conclusion of most myths. We see
the actual return to the order that was compromised by the crisis, or
even more often the binh of a completely new order in the religious
union of a community brought to life by its experience.
The perpetual conjunction in myths of a very guilty victim with a
conclusion that is both violent and liberating can only be explained by
the extreme force of the scapegoat mechanism. This hypothesis in fact
solves the fundamental enigma of all mythology: the order that is either
absent or compromised by the scapegoat once more establishes itself or
is established by the intervention of someone who disturbed it in the
first place. It is conceivable that a victim may be responsible for public
disasters, which is what happened in myths as in collective persecu­
tions, but in myths, and only in myths, this same victim restores the
order, symbolizes, and even incarnates it.
Our specialists have not yet gotten over this. The transgressor
restores and even establishes the order he has somehow transgressed in
anticipation. The greatest of all delinquents is transformed into a pillar
of society. In some myths this paradox is diminished, censured, or
camouflaged, no doubt by the faithful whom it scandalizes almost as

WHAT IS A MYTH?

much as our contemporary ethnologists, but i t i s no less transparent
beneath the camouflage. This is eminently characteristic of mythology.
Plato was troubled by this precise enigma when he complained of the
immorality of the Homeric gods. Interpreters have stumbled over this
enigma for centuries. It is identical with the enigma of the primitive
sacred, the beneficial return from the harmful omnipotence attributed
to the scapegoat. To understand this return and solve the enigma, we
have to reexamine our conjunction of themes, our four stereotypes of
persecution, somewhat deformed, plus the conclusion that reveals for us
the persecutors reconciled. They really must be reconciled. There is no
reason to doubt it since they commemorate their experiences after the
death of the victim and always attribute them unhesitatingly to him.
On further thought this is not surprising. How could the persecu­
tors explain their own reconciliation and the end of the crisis? They can­
not take credit for it. Terrified as they are by their own victim, they see
themselves as completely passive, purely reactive, totally controlled by
this scapegoat at the very moment when they rush to his attack. They
think that all initiative comes from him. There is only room for a single
cause in their field of vision, and its triumph is absolute, it absorbs all
other causality: it is the scapegoat. Thus nothing happens to the perse­
cutors that is not immediately related to him, and if they happen to
become reconciled, the scapegoat benefits. There is only one person
responsible for everything, one who is absolutely responsible, and he
will be responsible for the cure because he is already responsible for the
sickness. This is only a paradox for someone with a dualistic vision who
is too remote from the experience of a victim to feel the unity and is too
determined to differentiate precisely between "good" and "evil:'
Admittedly, scapegoats cure neither real epidemics nor droughts
nor floods. But the main dimension of every crisis is the way in which
it affects human relations. A process of bad reciprocity is its own initia­
tor; it gains nourishment from itself and has no need of external causes
in order to continue. As long as external causes exist, such as an epidemic
of plague for example, scapegoats will have no efficacy. On the other
hand, when these causes no longer exist, the first scapegoat to appear
will bring an end to the crisis by eliminating all the interpersonal reper­
cussions in the concentration of all evildoing in the person of one vic­
tim. The scapegoat is only effective when human relations have broken
down in crisis, but he gives the impression of effecting external causes
as well, such as plagues, droughts, and other objective calamities.

44

THE SCAPEGOAT

Beyond a certain threshold ofbelief, the effect of the scapegoat is to
reverse the relationships between persecutors and their victims, thereby
producing the sacred, the founding ancestors and the divinities. The
victim, in reality passive, becomes the only effective and omnipotent
cause in the face of a group that believes itself to be entirely passive. If
groups of people can, as a group, become sick for reasons that are objec­
tive or that concern only themselves, if the relationships at the heart of
these groups can deteriorate and then be reestablished by means of vic­
tims who are unanimously despised, obviously these groups will com­
memorate these social ills in conformance with the illusory belief that
the scapegoat is omnipotent and facilitates the cure. The universal
execration of the person who causes the sickness is replaced by universal
veneration for the person who cures that same sickness.
We can trace in myths a system of representation of persecutions
similar to our own but complicated by the effectiveness of the process of
persecution. We are not willing to recognize that effectiveness because
it scandalizes us on the levels of both morality and intelligence. We are
able to recognize the first evil transfiguration of the victim, which seems
normal, but we cannot recognize the second beneficent transfiguration;
it is inconceivable that it can unite with the first without destroying it,
at least initially.
People in groups are subject to sudden variations in their relation­
ships, for bener or worse. If they attribute a complete cycle of variations
to the collective victim who facilitates the return to normal, they will
inevitably deduce from this double transference belief in a transcen­
dental power that is both double and will bring them alternatively both
loss and health, punishment and recompense. This force is manifest
through the acts of violence of which it is the victim but is also, more
importantly, the mysterious instigator.
If this victim can extend his benefits beyond death to those who
have killed him, he must either be resuscitated or was not truly dead.
The causality of the scapegoat is imposed with such force that even
death cannot prevent it. In order not to renounce the victim's causality,
he is brought back to life a11d immortalized, temporarily, and what we
call the transcendent and supernatural are invented for that purpose. 3

Violence and Magic
IN ORDER TO explain the sacred, I have compared persecutors' represen­
tations of persecution which involve the sacred with those which do not.
I have examined what was specific to mythological compared with
historical persecutions, but I have neglected the relative quality of that
specificity. I have discussed historical distortions as if they had no con­
nection with the sacred. But they do. Although increasingly less appar­
ent, the sacred still persists in medieval and modem texts. I have
omitted these instances of survival in order not to minimize the distance
between mythology and my chosen texts. Reliance on approximate
similarities is all the more annoying in a context where a perfect expla­
nation for dissimilarities exists - the scapegoat mechanism, the real
origin of the various kinds of distortions found in persecution, both
unintelligible and intelligible, mythological or otherwise, according to
the order within which persecution is operating.
Now that I have identified this difference in order, I can return to
the traces of the sacred that persist in intelligible distortions and con­
sider whether they function as they do in myths.
H��-red-plays a prominent role in medieval persecutions, and it is
easy to see nothing but hatred, especially where the Jews are concerned.
During this period, however, Jewish medicine enjoyed exceptional pres­
t�ge, which can be explained by the real superiority of their practi­
tioners, who were more open than others to scientific progress. But in
the particular case of the plague this explanation is scarcely convincing.
The best medicine is no more effective than the worst. Both the
aristocrats and the common people preferred Jewish doctors because
they associated their power to cure with the power to cause sickness.

46

THE SCAPEGOAT

This medical practice, therefore, cannot be viewed as an example of in­
dividuals who are distinguished from others by their lack of prejudice.
Prestige and prejudice seem to be two faces of the same attitude, indicat­
ing the survival of a primitive form of the sacred. Even in our own time
the almost sacred fear inspired by doctors is not altogether independent
of their authority.
If a person shows ill will to the Jew, he might infect him with the
plague. If, on the other hand, he shows good will, the Jew might spare
him or even cure him ifhe is already stricken. He is seen therefore as the
last resource because of, and not in spite of, the evil he can do or has al­
ready done. The same is true in the case of Apollo; if the Thebans beg
him (rather than some other god} to cure them of the plague, they do so
because they hold him ultimately responsible. Apollo should not there­
fore be seen as a particularly benevolent, peaceful, or serene god in the
sense Nietzsche and the aestheticians give to the word Apollonian. Like
so many others they were misled by the ultimate fading of the Olympian
gods. Despite appearances and weakened theories this tragic Apollo re­
mains "the most abominable" of all the gods, the formula Plato
reproached Homer for using, as if the poet had indulged in a personal
fantasy.
Apart from certain intense beliefs, the scapegoat no longer appears
to be merely a passive receptacle for evil forces but is rather the mirage
of an omnipotent manipulator shown by mythology to be sanctioned
unanimously by society. Once the scapegoat is recognized as the unique
cause of the plague, then the plague becomes his to dispose of at will,
either as punishment or reward, according to his displeasure or
pleasure.
Queen Elizabeth of England's Jewish doctor, Lopez, was executed at
the height ofhis influence for his attempts at poisoning and for his prac­
tice of magic. The slightest failure or denunciation can cause a new­
comer to fall far lower than the heights he has climbed. Thus, Oedipus,
the savior ofThebes and a licensed healer, who bears the signs of a vic­
tim, is crushed during times of trouble, just at the moment of his
greatest glory, a victim of one of the stereotypical accusations we have
identified. 1

1943), p. 98; H. Michelson, TheJew in Early Englisll literature (Amsterdam: A.j. Paris, 1928),

The supernatural aspect of the offense is coupled with a crime in
the modern sense, in response to the demand for rationality that is
characteristic of a time in which belief in magic is dwindling. The im­
portant detail is the fact that it is poisoning, a crime that deprives the ac­
cused of any legal protection just as bluntly as any accusation directly
involving magic. Poisoning is so easy to conceal, especially for a doctor,
that it is impossible to prove the crime and therefore there is no need to
prove it.
This brings us back to all of our examples at once. It contains fea­
tures which recall the myth of Oedipus, others which remind us of Guil­
laume de Machaut and all the persecuted Jews, and still others which
are reminiscent of the false myth I concocted to "historicize" that of
Oedipus and demonstrate that the decision to define a text as historical
or mythological is arbitrary.
Because of the historical context we automatically demystifY it with
a psychosociological interpretation. We sense a cabal organized by jeal­
ous rivals, and we immediately lose awareness of those aspects that re­
mind us of the sacred in mythology.
Lopez, like Oedipus, and like Apollo himself, is both master of life
and master of death, for he controls this terrible plague, the sickness.
One moment Lopez miraculously dispenses cures, the next, no less
miraculously, sickness which is within his capability to cure if he so
pleases. It is inevitable that the historical requirements of the text re­
mind us of the sort of interpretation that is considered blasphemous
and almost inconceivable in mythology, particularly Greek mythology.
Presented in the form of myth it becomes a powerful symbol of the
human condition, of the heights and depths of destiny. How the
humanists rejoice! Put the story in an Elizabethan setting and it is
nothing more than a sordid palace scandal, typical of the frenzied ambi­
tions, hypocritical violence, and superstition that are rife only in the
modem Western world. The second vision is certainly more accurate
than the first, but still not entirely so, given that a remnant of uncon­
scious persecution still plays a role in the Lopez affair. No allowance is
made for this. What is more, a shadow is cast on our historical universe

by presenting real crimes against a false background of Rousseau-like in­
nocence of which it alone is deprived.
Behind the warrior gods there are always victims, and victims are
usually linked to medicine. Just as in the case of the Jews, the same men
who denounce the witches go to them for help. All persecutors attribute
to their victims both the capacity to do harm and its reverse.
All aspects of mythology can be found in a less extreme form in me­
dieval persecutions. This is true in the case ofthe monstrous, which can
be easily recognized if the effort is made to compare phenomena that,
out of ignorance, have been considered incomparable.
The confusion of animals and men provides mythology with its
most important and spectacular modality of the monstrous. The same
confusion can be found in medieval victims. Sorcerers and witches are
thought to have a particular affinity with the goat, an extremely evil ani­
mal. During the trials, suspects' feet are examined to see if they are
cloven; their foreheads are tapped for any trace of a hom. The gradual
disappearance of the borderline between animal and man in thost'j who
are marked as victims is an important concept. If the alleged witch pos­
sesses a pet, a cat, a dog, or a bird, she is immediately thought to resem­
ble that animal, and the animal itself seems almost an incarnation, a
temporary embodiment or a useful disguise to ensure the success of cer­
tain enterprises. These animals play exactly the same role as Jupiter's
swan in the seduction of Leda, or the bull with Pasiphae. We are dis­
tracted from the resemblance by the extremely negative connotations of
monstrosity in the medieval world which are almost always positive in
later mythology and in our modem conception of mythology. During
recent centuries, writers, artists, and even contemporary anthropolo­
gists have completed the process of mitigation and criticism begun in
the so-called classical era. I will return to this later.
The almost mythological figure of the old witch is a good example
of the tendency to merge moral and physical monstrosities that was
mentioned in our discussion of mythology. She is lame and bandy­
legged, and her face is covered with warts and various excretions that
emphasize its ugliness. Everything about her attracts persecution. The
same was clearly true for the Jews in medieval and modem anti·
Semitism. All that is needed is a number of victims' signs centered in a
group of individuals who then become the target for the majority.
The Jew is also thought to be connected with the goat and certain
other animals. The concept of the suppression of differences between

VIOLE N CE AND MAGIC

49

man and animal reappears in this context in an unexpected form. In
1 575, for example, the illustrated Wunderzeitung of Johann Fischart, of
Binzwangen, near Augsburg, shows a Jewish woman contemplating two
little pigs to whom she has just given birth.2
Although this type of thing is found throughout world mythology
the similarity eludes us because the scapegoat mechanism is not func­
tioning within the same order in the two cases and the social result can­
not be compared. The higher order of mythology ends with the victim
becoming sacred, thereby concealing from us, and in some cases totally
eliminating, the distortions of persecution.
Let us look at a myth that is very important throughout the north­
west of Canada, in an area around the Arctic Circle. It is the original
myth of the Dogrib Indians. I will quote Roger Bastide's summary of it
in the volume Ethnologie genirale of the Encylopidie de Ia P/eiade
(p. 1 065).
A woman has intercourse with a dog and gives binh to six puppies. Her tribe
banishes her and she is forced to hunt for her own food. One day as she returns
from the bush she discovers that the puppies are children and that they shed
their animal skins the moment she leaves the house. So she pretends to leave and
when her children are as it were undressed she takes their skins away, forcing
them to keep their human identity from now on.

All the stereotypes of persecution we have identified exist in this
story though they are somewhat difficult to distinguish. Even their fu­
sion is revealing. The general loss of differences that I term crisis is indi­
cated here in the mother's hesitation between human and dog, and that
same hesitation is seen in the children, who represent the community.
The fact that she is a woman is the stereotypical victim's sign, and the
stereotypical crime is bestiality. The woman is certainly responsible for
the crisis since she gives birth to a monstrous community. But the myth
tacitly admits the truth. There is no difference between the woman
criminal and the community: both are undifferentiated, and the com­
munity existed before the crime, since it is the community that punishes
the crime. This is therefore an example of a scapegoat accused of a
stereotypical crime and treated accordingly: her tribe banishes her and she
is forced to hunt for her own food . . . .
We don't recognize the connection with the Jewish woman from
Binzwangen accused ofgiving birth to pigs because the scapegoat mech2. Tl"achtenberg, The Devil and the Jews, pp. 52-5 3 .

50

T H E SCAPEGOAT

anism is at work throughout and becomes fundamental; it turns into
something positive. That is why the community exists both before and
after the crime it is punishing: it is born of this crime, not of its mon­
strosity which is temporary in nature, but of its humanity which is well
defined. Thanks to the scapegoat who is at first accused of causing the
community to vacillate between human and animal, the difference be­
tween the two is permanently settled. The woman-dog becomes a great
goddess who punishes not only bestiality but also incest and all other
stereotypical crimes, all infractions of society's fundamental rules. The
apparent cause of disorder becomes the apparent cause of order because
she is a victim who rebuilds the terrified unity of a grateful community,
.at first in opposition to her, and finally around her.
There are two stages in myths, but interpreters have failed to distin­
guish them. The first is the act of accusing a scapegoat who is not yet
sacred to whom all evil characteristics adhere. Then comes the second
stage when he is made sacred by the community's reconciliation. I have
succeeded in identifying this first stage by means of its equivalent in
historical texts that reflect the perspective of the persecutor. These texts
are all the more appropriate for guiding an interpreter toward this first
stage because they are almost exclusively limited to it.
Texts ofpersecution indicate that myths comprise a first transfigura­
tion similar to that of our persecutors that is really only the substructure
of the second transfiguration. Mythological persecutors, more credu­
lous than their historical equivalents, are so taken with what is accom­
plished by their scapegoats that they are truly reconciled, and their fear
of the victim and hostility toward him are supplemented by adoration.
It is difficult to understand this second transfiguration which has almost
no equivalent in our universe. But once it has been clearly distinguished
from the first it can be analyzed logically, beginning with the differences
between the two types of texts being compared, especially in the conclu­
sion. Finally, I have confirmed the accuracy of this analysis of establish­
ing that the faint traces of the sacred still clinging to historical victims
bear too close a resemblance to the vanished forms of the sacred for them
to have evolved from an independent mechanism.
Collective violence must therefore be recognized as a mechanism
that is still creating myths in our universe, but, for reasons we shall
learn more about, is functioning less and less well. The second of the
two mythical transfigurations is obviously the most fragile since it has

V IOLENC E AND MAGIC

51

almost entirely disappeared. Modem Western history is characterized by
the decay of mythic forms that only survive as phenomena of persecu­
tion and are almost entirely limited to the first transfiguration. If the
mythological distortion is directly proportional to the belief of the
persecutors, this decline might well constitute the other side of our
growing yet imperfect ability to decode. This ability to decode began
with the decomposition of the sacred and then developed into our abil­
ity to read the partially decomposed forms. As our ability grows we are
encouraged to go back to the forms that are still intact and decode the
meaning of real myths.
Apart from the complete reversal involved in the conversion to the
sacred, there are no greater distortions of persecution in the Dogrib
myth than in our passage from Guillaume de Machaut. It is primarily
the element of the sacred that interferes with our understanding. If we
do not recognize the double transfiguration of the scapegoat, then un­
doubtedly the phenomenon of the sacred, illusory as it seems to us, will
be no less impenetrable than it was for the faithful of the Dogrib cult.
Myths and rites contain everything necessary to analyze this phenome­
non but we do not recognize it.
Will we trust the myth too much ifwe assume that their victims and
scapegoats are real? That criticism will certainly be made, but the same
situation faces the interpreter of the Dogrib texts as in the preceding
examples. It contains too many stereotypes of persecution for the text to
be purely imaginary. Extreme distrust is as destructive to the under­
standing of myths as an excess of belief. My interpretation seems rash
only if judged by standards that cannot be applied to the stereotypes of
persecution.
I could of course be mistaken in the particular myth I have chosen,
that of the woman-dog. This myth could have been made up of various
pieces for reasons similar to those that led me earlier to invent a ''false"
myth of Oedipus. The mistake in that case would be purely local and
would not compromise the accuracy of the whole interpretation. Even
if the Dogrib myth were not the result of actual collective violence it
would be the work of a competent imitator, capable of reproducing the
textual effects of this type of violence; it would therefore still provide a
valuable example like my false myth of Oedipus. If I were to assume
there was a real victim behind the text I have just invented I would be
making a huge mistake, but my error would not, in fact, be any less faith-

52

THE SCAPEGOAT

fu l to the truth of the majority of texts containing the same stereotypes
and similar structure. It is statistically inconceivable that all these texts
could have been forgeries.
Clearly, the same concept can be applied when we consider the ex­
ample of the Jewish woman of Binzwangen accused of giving birth to
monsters. A slight change of decor and a weakening of the positive qual­
ity of the sacred would point my critics in the direction of an interpreta­
tion they consider unacceptable. The type of interpretation demanded
of myths is suddenly gone from their minds; and if it is imposed on
them they themselves denounce its mystifying character. All interp reta­
tions that do not attempt to demystify persecution are in fact regressive
despite their noisy avant-garde posture.
ETHNOlOGISTS BELIEVE their work is far removed from my thesis, but in

certain areas it comes very close. Ethnology has long recognized in what
it calls "magical thought" a supernatural explanation, and of the causal
type. Hubert and Mauss saw in magic "a gigantic variation on the theme
of the principle of causality?' This type of causality precedes and some­
what heralds that of science. In accord with the ideological mind-set of
the time the ethnologists insist on the similarities rather than the differ­
ences between the two types of interpretation. The differences are im­
portant to those who boast of the superiorities of science; the similar­
ities, on the other hand, are important to those who insist on the unity
of human thought.
Levi-Strauss belongs to both groups. In The Savage Mind, he takes
Hubert and Mauss's formula and defines rites and magical beliefs as "so
many expressions of an act of faith in a science yet to be born?'3 Al­
though the intellectual aspect interests him, in support of what he has
to say he quotes a text of Evans-Pritchard which immediately clarifies
the identity of magical thought and of the witch-hunt:
Notions of witchcraft comprise natural and moral philosophies. As a natural
philosophy it reveals a theory of causation. Misfortune is due to witchcraft co­
operating with natural forces. If a buffalo gores a man, or the supports of a gran­
ary are undermined by termites so that it falls on his head, or he is infected with
cerebro-spinal meningitis, Azande say that the buffalo, the granary, and the dis-

VIOLENCE AND MAGIC

53

ease, are causes which combine with witchcraft to kill a man. Witchcraft does
not create the buffalo and the granary and the disease for these exist in their own
right, but it is responsible for the particular situation in which they are brought
into lethal relations with a particular man. The granary would have fallen in
any case, but since there was witchcraft present it fell at the particular moment
when a certain man was resting beneath it. Of these causes the only one which
permits intervention is witchcraft, for witchcraft emanates from a person. The
buffalo and the granary do not allow intervention and are, therefore, whilst
recognized as causes, not considered the socially relevant ones.4

The term natural philosophy invokes the image of Rousseau's "noble
savage," who wonders innocently about the "mysteries of nature." In
reality magical thought does not originate in disinterested curiosity. It is
usually the last resort in a time of disaster, and provides principally a
system of accusation. It is always the other who plays the role of the sor­
cerer and acts in an unnatural fashion to harm his neighbor.
Evans-Pritchard illustrates what I have illustrated myself but in the
language of ethnologists. Magical thought seeks "a significant cause on
the level of social relations;• in other words a human being, a victim, a
scapegoat. It is not necessary to identifY the exact nature of the corrective
intervention that results from the magical explanation. Everything he
mentions is applicable not only to the normal phenomena of magic in
the ethnological universe but also to the whole range of persecution of
phenomena, from medieval violence to mythology proper.
Thebes is not unaware that epidemics strike human communities
from time to time. But the people of Thebes ask why our city at this par­
ticular time? Those who are suffering are not interested in natural
causes. Only magic makes "corrective intervention" possible, and every­
one eagerly seeks a magician who can put things right. There is no
remedy against the plague as is, or against Apollo if you will. On the
other hand, there is nothing to prevent the cathartic correction of the
unfortunate Oedipus.
Levi-Strauss makes the same suggestion in his essays on magical
thought, but he pushes the art of litotes even further than Evans­
Pritchard. He admits that despite certain results "of good scientific
standing'' magic generally cuts a poor figure compared with science but
not for the reasons imagined by the devotees of "primitive thought?'

. . . magical thought . . . can be distinguished from science not so much by any
ignorance or contempt of determinism but by a more imperious and uncom ­
promising demand for it which can at the most be regarded as unreasonable and
precipitate from the scientific point of view.5

Magical thought is generally perceived as a defensive action against
magic; it results in the same type of behavior as displayed by the witch­
hunters or by the Christian mobs during the Black Death. Moreover, we
rightly describe all these people as reasoning in magical fashion, or even
mythological fashion, as I recall. The two terms are synonymous and
equally justifiable. This is unwittingly demonstrated by Evans­
Pritchard. There is no essential difference between the representation
and behavior of magic in history and in mythology.
The moral attitude of the two disciplines, history and ethnology,
makes all the difference. Historians emphasize the dimension of perse­
cution and loudly denounce the intolerance and superstition that
make such things possible. The ethnologists are only interested in the
epistemological aspects and the theory of causes. One need only reverse
the fields of application without changing the language to assert once
more the schizophrenic nature of our culture. This assertion inevitably
makes us uneasy; it affect the values that are dear to us and are consid­
ered inviolable. This is no reason to transfer that uneasiness to those
who identified it and treat them as scapegoats. Yet the reason is the
same, basic, immemorial reason- only in its modem, intellectualized
version. All this tends to set the unconscious mechanism in motion once
again. In order to fill the cracks and holes in the system, we resort more
or less unconsciously to the generative and regenerative mechanism of this
same system. In our day, the emphasis is on the less, rather than the
more. Even though there are more and more persecutions, there are less
unconscious persecutors and truly unperceived distortions in the
representation of the victims. Because of this there is less resistance to
the truth, and all of mythology will soon be understood.
MYTHS REPRESENT persecutions similar to those we have already inter­

preted, but they are more difficult to decode because they contain greate!
distortions. The transfigurations are stronger in mythology. The victims
become monstrous and display fantastic power. After �owing disorder,
they reestablish order and become founding fathers or gods. This addi5. The Saoage Mind, p. 10.

tional element of transfiguration, however, does not prevent the compar­
ison of myths with historical persecutions. The explanation lies in the
mechanism identified in those representations already decoded, from
which we must now seek an even more effective function. The return to
peace and order is ascribed to the same cause as the earlier troubles -to
the victim himself. That is what makes the victim sacred and transforms
the persecution into a point of religious and cultural departure. The
whole process, in effect, serves as: (1) a model for mythology in which
it is commemorated as a religious epiphany; (2) a model for ritual which
is forced to reproduce it on the principle that the action or experience
of the victim, in that it was beneficial, must always be repeated; and (3)
a countermodel for the forbidden, by virtue of the principle that one
must never repeat the actions of this same victim, insofar as they were
harmful.
There is nothing in mythico-ritual religions that does not unfold
logically from the fact that the scapegoat mechanism functions on a
higher order than in history. There was good reason for past ethnology
to assume a close relationship between myths and rituals, but the
enigma of this relationship was never resolved because it was never un­
derstood that the phenomena of persecution provided both the model
and the countermodel for every religious institution. The first detail, of
which the second is only the reflection, was sometimes identified in
myths and sometimes in rituals. By dint offailure the ethnologists gave
up questioning the nature and relationship of religious institutions.
The effect of the scapegoat resolves a problem that contemporary
ethnologists do not even recognize. To understand the magnitude of my
proposed solution we must consider the relationship to the actual event
described of the account given by the persecutors of their own persecu­
tion. A detached observer who is present at, but does not participate in,
an episode of collective violence, only sees a helpless victim mistreated
by a hysterical crowd But ifhe asks the members of that crowd what is
happening he will scarcely recognize what he has seen with his own
eyes. He will be told about the extraordinary power of the victim, the
occult influence he exercised and possibly still exercises on the commu­
nity, for he has no doubt escaped death, etc.
The distance between what actually happened and the way it is per­
ceived by the persecutors must be further enlarged in order to under­
stand the relationship between myths and rituals. In the most primitive
rites we see a disorderly crowd that gradually focuses on one victim and

56

T H E SCAPEGOAT

ends by flinging itself on him. The myth describes the story of a formi­
dable god who saved the faithful by some sacrifice, or by dying after
spreading disorder in the community.
The faithful of these cults declare that they are reenacting in their
rites what happened in the myths. We cannot understand this statement
since we see in the rites an unleashed mob that harms a victim, and the
myths speak of an all-powerful god who dominates a community. We do
not understand that it is the same person in both cases because we can­
not conceive of distortions of persecution powerful enough to conse­
crate the victim.
Past ethnology is right to suspect that the most brutal rites are the
most primitive. They may not be the most ancient on an absolute scale
of chronology, but they are the closest to their violent origin, and there­
fore the most revealing. Although myths use as their model the same
sequence of persecution as rites, they resemble them least at the
moment ofgreatest resemblance. The words in this case are more decep­
tive than actions, and invariably deceive the ethnologists. They see only
that the very same episode of collective violence is much closer to what
actually takes place in the ritual than in the myth. Indeed in rituals the
faithful repeat the collective violence of their predecessors; they imitate
that violence, and their representation of what happened does not in­
fluence their behavior as much as their words. The words are entirely
determined by the representation of persecution, that is, by the sym­
bolic power of the appointed victim, whereas the ritual actions are
directly patterned on the actions of the crowd of persecutors.

CHAPTER FIVE

Teotihuacan
MYCRITICS CONSTANTLY accuse me of switching back and fonh between

the representation and the reality of what is being represented. Readers
who have been following the text attentively will understand that I do
not deserve the reproach or, ifl do, we all deserve it equally because we
affirm the existence of real victims behind the almost mythological texts
of medieval persecutors.
I shall now tum to myths that are more problematic for my thesis,
at least on the surface, since they deny the relevance of collective murder
for mythology. One of the ways of denying that relevance is by affirming
that, although they are dead, the victims went to their death willingly.
How should the myths of self-sacrifice in primitive societies be inter­
:preted? Let us look at a great American myth of self-sacrifice, the Aztec
myth of the creation of the sun and moon. Like almost everything else
.we know about the Aztecs we owe this to Bernardino de Sahag-Un, the
'author of Historia general de las casas de Ia Nueva Espana. Georges
"Bataille has given in La Part maudite a paraphrased translation of the
myth, which I will cite in abbreviated form:
They say that before there was day in the world, the gods came together in that

�lace which is named Teotihuacan. They said to one another: "0 gods, who will

have the burden of lighting the world?" Then to these words answered a god
,named Tecuciztecatl, and he said: "I shall take the burden oflighting the world?'
Then once more the gods spoke, and they said: "Who will be another?" Then
,they looked at one another, and deliberated on who the other should be. And
none of them dared offer himself for that office. All were afraid and declined.
One of the gods, to whom no one was paying any attention, and who was
covered with pustules, did not speak but listened to what the other gods were

58

THE SCAPEGOAT

saying. And the others spoke to him and said to him: ''You be the one who i s to
give light, little pustule-covered one." And right willingly he obeyed what they
commanded, and he answered: "Thankfully I accept what you have com­
manded me to do. Let it be as you say?' And then both began to perform
penances for four days . . . .
And midnight having come, all the gods placed themselves about the
hearth, called teotexca/li. In this place the fire blazed four days. The aforemen­
tioned gods arranged themselves in two rows, some at one side of the fire, some
at the other side. And then the two gods above mentioned placed themselves
before the fire, between the two rows of gods, all of whom were standing. And
then the gods spoke, and said to Tecuciztecatl : "How now, Tecuciztecatl! Go
into the fire!" And then he braced himself to cast himself into the fire.
And since the fire was large and blazed high, as he felt the great heat of the
fire, he became frightened and dared not cast himself into the fire. He turned
back. Once more he turned to throw himselfinto the fire, making an effort and
drawing nearer, to cast himself into the flames. But, feeling the great heat, he
held back and dared not cast himself into it. Four times he tried, but never let
himself go. Since he had tried four times, the gods then spoke to Nanauatzin,
and said to him: "How now, Nanauatzin! You try!" And when the gods had
addressed him, he exerted himself and with closed eyes undertook the ordeal
and cast himself into the flames. And then he began to crackle and pop in the
fire l ike one who is roasted.
And when Tecuciztecatl saw that Nanauatzin had cast himself into the
flames, and was burning, he gathered himself and threw himself into the fire.
And it is said that an eagle entered the blaze and also burned itself; and for that
reason it has dark brown or blackened feathers. Finally a tiger entered; it did not
bum itself, but singed itself; and for that reason remained stained black and
white . . . .
And they say that after this the gods knelt down to wait to see where Nanau·
atzin, become sun, would rise . . . . And when the sun came to rise, he looked
very red. He appeared to waddle from one side to the other. No one could look
at him, because he snatched sight from the eyes. He shone and cast rays oflight
from him in grand style. His light and his rays he poured forth in all directions.
And thereafter the moon rose on the horizon. Having hestitated, Tecuciztecatl
was less brilliant . . . . Later the gods all had to die. The wind Kwetzalcoatl killed
them all; it tore out their hearts and gave life to the newborn stars.1

The first god is not chosen by anyone -he truly volunteers- but
this is not true for the second god. Later on, the reverse is true. The
second god throws himself into the fire immediately without being

T E O T I HU A C A N

urged, which is not true of the first. In each case there is an element of
constraint in the behavior of these two gods. As we look from one to the
other we see reversals that are translated into both differences and sym­
metries. We must not forget the former but, contrary to what the struc­
turalists think, it is never the difference but rather the symmetries- the
aspects shared by the victims -that are the most revealing.
The myth emphasizes the free and voluntary aspect of their deci­
sion. The gods are great, and they give themselves to death essentially
oftheir own free will, to secure the continued existence of the world and
of mankind. Nevertheless there is an obscure element of constraint in
both cases that gives us pause. The little pockmarked god shows great
docility. He exalts in the idea of dying for such a wonderful cause as
the birth of the sun but he is not a volunteer. Unquestionably, all the
gods share in the weakness. They are frightened, intimidated, and dare
not "offer themselves for that job:' The weakness might be said to be
very slight, but later we shall see a tendency in myths to minimize the
weaknesses of the gods. In any case it is a weakness that the pockmarked
one displays briefly before he courageously undertakes the mission en­
trusted to him.
Nanauatzin possesses a distinctive feature that cannot fail to attract
our attention, the pocks or sores that make him a leper, someone
stricken with the plague, the embodiment of contagious disease. From
my perspective of collective persecution we must recognize in this a
preferential sign for the selection of a victim. The question follows
whether it is not this sign that determines the choice of victim, in which
case it would be a question of a victim and a collective murder rather
than a self-sacrifice. The myth, of course, does not say this, but we must
not expect the myth to reveal this type of truth. The myth does, how­
ever, confirm Nanauatzin's probable role as a scapegoat by presenting
him as a god "to whom no one was paying any attention"; he stands to
one side and remains silent.
We should note in this passage that the Aztec sun-god is also the
god of pestilence, like the Greek god Apollo. Apollo's resemblance to
the Aztec god might be greater if Olympian censure had not cleansed
him of all the stigmata of a victim. There are many examples of this
combination. What do pestilence and the sun have in common? To un­
derstand this we must break away from the insipid concepts of symbol­
ism and of the unconscious, whether collective or individual. If we
select only what we want to see then inevitably we find what we

60

THE SCAPEGOAT

want to find. Instead we should confront the scene in question. It is
common for plague victims to be burned because fire has always been
considered the most effective means of purification. This connec­
ion is not made explicitly in our myth, but we can sense its presence
which becomes explicit in other American myths. Fire appears more
frequently as the contagion becomes more menacing. Add to this the
scapegoat mechanism and the torturers who already hold their vic­
tim responsible for the epidemic will now hold him responsible for
the cure.
Sun-gods must be people so sick that men turn to a great fire such
as Teotihuacan's to destroy them. If then the epidemic recedes, the
victim becomes divine in that he is burned and becomes one with the
fire that instead of destroying him mysteriously transforms him into a
force for good. The victim is thus transformed into that inextinguish­
able flame that shines on humanity. Where can this flame be found
thereafter? The answer is immediately apparent. It can only be in the
sun, or possibly in the moon and the stars. Only the celestial bodies give
man light permanently; but there is no guarantee they will always do so.
To assure their benevolent collaboration they must be nourished and
provided with victims, to assure their regeneration, victims will always
be needed.
Obviously, by the same process of shooting rays on the crowd the
god confers benefits and inflicts harm. They bring light, heat, and fertil­
ity but they also bring disease. They become the darts hurled at the
Thebans by an irritated Apollo. All these themes can be found in the
worship of Saint Sebastian at the end of the Middle Ages and form a
part ofthe representation of persecution. They are generated by a much
weaker version of the scapegoat mechanism.2
Saint Sebastian is thought to protect one against the plague because
he is covered with arrows, and arrows seem to have the same significance
as they had for the Greeks and no doubt for the Aztecs: they imply the
sun's rays or pestilence. Epidemics are frequently portrayed as a rain of
arrows hurled at men by the Eternal Father and even by Christ. There
is affinity between Saint Sebastian and the arrows, or rather the pesti·
lence; the faithful hope that his presence in their churches will attract
the wandering arrows to him and spare them. Saint Sebastian is offered
2. Delumeau, La Peur en Occidenr, p. 107.

T E O T I HUACAN

61

as the preferred target for the malady; he is brandished like the serpent
of brass in front of the Hebrews.
The saint thus plays the role of scapegoat: he protects because he is
tainted; he is consecrated in the primitive double sense of cursed and
blessed. Like all primitive gods, the saint protects as long as he monopo­
lizes and incarnates the plague. The evil aspect of this incarnation has
almost disappeared. We must therefore be careful not to say: "It is
exactly the same as in the case of the Aztecs?' It is not the same because
violence plays no role, but it is certainly the same mechanism and is
more readily identified because of the much reduced level of belief at
which it is operating.
Ifwe compare Saint Sebastian with the persecuted Jews and doctors
we see that the evil and beneficial aspects are in inverse proportion. Real
persecutions and the "pagan" primitive aspects of the cult of saints are
unequally affected by the decomposition of mythology. The only fault
with which we can reproach Nanauatzin is that he waits passively to be
selected. On the other hand the god unquestionably possesses one of
the preferential signs of victims. The opposite is true of Tecuciztecatl
who does not bear the mark of a victim but who proves to be both
extremely boastful and extremely cowardly. Even if he has not commit­
ted a crime against nature, his constant boastfulness during the four
days of penance make him guilty of hubris in a sense similar to that of
the, Greeks.
There would be no sun or moon without victims; the world would
be plunged in obscurity and chaos. This is the basis of the whole of
Aztec religion. The point of departure in our myth is the total lack of
difference between day and night. In this we have a classic stereotype of
crisis, the social setting most favorable for the scapegoat mechanism. We
now have three ofthe four stereotypes: a crisis, faults if not crimes, one
ofthe preferential signs of a victim, and two violent deaths which liter­
ally produce the differentiating decision. The result is not only the
appearance of two luminous and very distinct stars but also the specific
coloration of two kinds of animals, the eagle and the tiger.
The only stereotype missing is collective murder. The myth assures
us that there is no murder since death is voluntary. But I have pointed
out the fortuitous inclusion of an element of constraint in the free will
of the two victims. Finally, if we need to be convinced of the presence
of collective murder, however superficially denied or camouflaged, we

62

T H E SCAPEGOAT

need only look at the crucial scene. The gods are lined up menacingly
on two sides. They have organized the whole affair and regulate every
detail. They always act in unison and speak with a single voice, first to
choose the second "volunteer" and then to order the two victims to
throw themselves "voluntarily" into the fire. What would happen ifthe
fainthearted volunteer did not choose to follow his companion's exam­
ple? Would the gods around him allow him to resume his place among
them as if nothing had happened? Or would their forms of encourage­
ment become more brutal? The idea that the victims could freely escape
from their demiurgic task seems unlikely. If one of them sought to
escape, the two parallel lines of gods could quickly form a circle and
push the victim into the fire by closing in on him. I would like the reader
to remember this circular or almost circular configuration which will
reappear, with or without the fire, and with or without any apparent
victim, in a great many of the myths I shall be discussing.
The sacrifice of the two victims is in essence presented to us as an
act of free will, a self-sacrifice, but in both cases a subtle element of
constraint eats away at that freedom on two different occasions. This
element of constraint is decisive. It provides yet another detail in this
text to suggest the phenomenon of persecution, mythologized by the
perspective ofthe persecutors. Three of the four stereotypes are present,
and the fourth is strongly suggested as much by the victims' death as by
the general configuration of the scene. If we were to see this same scene
as a silent living tableau we would have no doubt that the victims were
put to death and that their consent was of almost no concern for those
making the sacrifice. Our doubts would be confirmed by the knowledge
that human sacrifice was a typical religious activity ofthe Aztec civiliza­
tion. Some experts have mentioned as many as twenty thousand victims
a year at the time of Cortes's conquest. Even if considerable allowance
is made for exaggeration, human sacrifice still plays a monstrous role
among the Aztecs. As a people they were constantly occupied with
fighting not for the expansion of territory but to obtain the victims
necessary for the innumerable sacrifices recounted by Bernardino de
Sahagun.
Ethnologi�ts have known these facts for centuries, ever since the
first deciphering of the representations of persecution in the Western
world. But they have not drawn the same conclusions. They spend most
of their time minimizing, if not actually justifying, among the Aztecs
what they rightly condemn in their own universe. Once again we see the

T E O T I H UACAN

63

different means of measurement characteristic of anthropology when
dealing with both historical and ethnological societies. Our inability to
decode more mystifying representations of persecution in myths than
the ones we can demystify is not merely the result of the complexity of
the undertaking or the extreme transfiguration of the data. Scholars
show an extraordinary reluctance to examine so-called ethnological soci­
eties as ruthlessly as they do their own.
Admittedly, ethnologists have a difficult task. "Their" cultures shat­
ter on the slightest contact with modern Western society to the point of
scarcely existing any more. Such a situation constantly triggers a form
of oppression that increases in bitterness the more it is scorned. Modern
intellectuals are obsessed by scorn and feel compelled to present
vanished worlds in the most favorable light. Our ignorance sometimes
becomes a resource. How can we criticize the religious life of these
people? We do not know enough to contradict when their victims are
presented as volunteers, as believers who silently allowed themselves to
be massacred in order to prolong the existence of the world. There exists
an ideology of sacrifice among the Aztecs which is revealed for what it
is in our myth. Without victims, the world would be plunged in dark­
ness and chaos. The first victims are not enough. At the end of the pas­
sage quoted, the sun and moon shine in the sky but do not move; to force
them to move, first every single god must be sacrificed, and then the
anonymous crowds which are substituted for them. Everything depends
on the sacrifice.
There is certainly "some truth" in the myth of the consenting
victim, and the myth reveals it. The boastful god overestimated his
strength; he recoiled at the crucial moment: this recoil suggests that all
the victims might not be as willing as the ethnologists would have us
believe. Tecuciztecatl ultimately overcomes his cowardice, and it is his
companion's example that makes the difference between the early
failures and the final success. This is the moment of revelation of the
force that dominates groups of men: imitation, mimesis. I have not
mentioned it until now because I wanted to demonstrate in the simplest
possible way the relevance of collective murder for the interpretation of
mythology; I wanted to introduce only those details that were strictly
indispensable, which cannot be said of mimesis. I will now indicate the
truly remarkable role it plays in our myth.
The future moon-god is obviously driven to volunteer by the wish
to outstrip all the other gods, the spirit of mimetic rivalry. He wants to

64

T H E S C A P E GOAT

be without a rival, the first among them, one who acts a s a model for
others without having a model himself. This is hubris, so exaggerated a
form of mimetic desire that he claims to be beyond all mimesis, to want
no other model than himself. If the moon-god cannot obey the injunc­
tion to throw himself into the fire it is clear that, having achieved the
first place that he claimed, he finds himself without a model; he can no
longer follow someone's guidance and must guide others. The very
reason that made him claim that first place is the reason that he is in­
capable of holding it: he is so totally mimetic. The second god, on the
other hand, the future sun, did not try to put himself forward; he is less
hysterically mimetic, which is why when his turn comes he resolutely
takes the initiative that his fellow god was unable to take. He is able to
become an effective model for one who cannot act without a model.
Mimetic elements can be found circulating through myths in a
hidden fashion. The moral of the fable does not exhaust them. The two
characters are contrasted within an even wider circle of imitation, the
assembled gods who are unified in mimesis and control the whole scene.
Everything the gods do is perfect because it is unanimous. Freedom and
constraint are bound inextricably by their subordination to the mimetic
power of the united gods. I have described the act of free will of the one
who in response to the gods' appeal goes voluntarily or throws himself
unhesitatingly into the fire, but this freedom is no more than the divine
will that continually says: "Go throw yourself into the fire:' It is the
equivalent of an immediate or delayed imitation of divine will. The
spontaneous act of will is the same as the irresistible hypnotic power of
the example. For our pockmarked god the message "Go throw yourself
into the fire" is immediately transformed into action; it already exerts an
exemplary force. For the other god the message is not enough; the addi­
tional spectacle of action is needed. Tecuciztecatl throws himself into
the fire because he sees his companion do so. He would appear at first
glance to be more mimetic but perhaps ultimately he is less mimetic.
The mimetic collaboration of victims with their executioners con­
tinues in the Middle Ages and even into our own time, though now the
forms are weaker. We are told that in the sixteenth century witches chose
their own stake; they were made to understand the horror of their mis­
deeds. Heretics too often called for the punishment merited by their
abominable beliefs; it would be lacking in charity to deprive them ofit.
In our own time all forms of Stalinism find viperous victims who will
confess far more than is asked of them, and rejoice in the just punish-

T E O T I H U ACAN

65

ment that awaits them. Fear is an insufficient explanation for this type
ofbehavior. Even Oedipus joins in the unified chorus that declaims his
abominable defilement. He asks the city ofThebes to spew him forth in
the same way as he causes himself to vomit.
When such attitudes appear in our society, we indignantly deny
them, yet we do not even wince at attr.ibuting them to the Aztecs or
other primitive people. Ethnologists eagerly describe the enviable lot of
these victims. In the time preceding their sacrifice they enjoy extraor­
dinary privileges so that they go to their death serenely, perhaps even
joyously. Jacques Soustelle, among others, warns his readers not to
interpret this religious butchery in the light of our current concepts.
That terrible sin of ethnocentrism is lying in wait for us and, no maner
what exotic societies do, we must guard against the slightest negative
judgment.3
However laudable is the desire to "rehabilitate" unappreciated
nations, some discernment should be used. The current excesses are as
ridiculous as the former arrogant exaggerations, but in reverse. It is the
same condescension in the end. The reason we do not apply the same
criteria to those societies as we do to our own results from the demagogic
reversal typical of our contemporary era. Otherwise our sources are
worthless and we would do well to remain silent. We either know
nothing about the Aztecs and never will; or our sources have value, and
honesty demands that we recognize that the Aztec religion has not yet
taken its rightful place in our planet's museum ofhuman horror. Anti­
ethnocentric zeal errs in justifying bloody orgies by accepting the obvi­
ously misleading self-image these people present.
Despite its sacrificial ideology, this atrocious and magnificent myth
ofTeotihuacan is a powerful witness against the vision of mystification.
If anything can humanize this text it is not the false idyll of victims and
executioners in our post-war era patterned on Rousseau and Nietzsche.
The hesitations I have identified, despite the false evidence surrounding
them, run counter to this hypocritical vision without openly contradict­
ing it. The myth's disturbing beauty cannot be separated from the kind
of tremulousness that takes possession of it. We must expand on this
tremulousness to rock the structure and bring it crashing down.

CHAPTER SIX

Ases, Curetes, and Titans
I HAVE BEEN discussing a myth in which collective murder is absent. I
shall now select a number of examples from myths, or the endless vari­
ants of myths, in which the central scene clearly depicts collective
murder but in which such an eff ort is made to avoid defining the deed
that the scene becomes a near caricature. The configuration of the scene
is always the same-the murderers are in a circle around their victim ­
but the obvious or intentional significance of the scenes can vary widely.
It may share only a single characteristic: the awareness that they do not
signify collective murder.
My second example belongs to Scandinavian mythology. Baldr is
the best of all the gods: he has no faults, is rich in virtues, and is incapa­
ble of violence. He is disturbed by dreams warning him that a threat of
death is hanging over him. He shares his anguish with his companions,
the Ases, who decide to "claim protection for Baldr against all danger?'
To achieve this, Frigg, his mother: "makes all animate and inanimate
creatures-fire, water, metals, stones, earth, wood, diseases, quadrupeds,
birds, snakes . . . . swear to do him no harm. Thus protected, Baldr
enjoys an extraordinary game with the Ases in the public square. They
hurl things at him and strike him with their swords but nothing wounds
him?'
The synopsis I have quoted is Georges Dumezil's in Mythe et
epopee.1 It is easy to understand why the eminent scholar considers the
game the Ases are playing astonishing. A little further on he will
1 Georges Dumezil, Mythe et epopee (Paris: Bibliotheque des sciences humains, 1 968),

p. 224.

ASES, CURETES, AND TITANS

67

describe this same game as both "spectacular" and "fake?' He arouses our
curiosity without satisfying it. What is there about this myth that pro­
vokes our astonishment? Is the scene unusual or, on the contrary, very
familiar, totally ordinary, yet endowed with an unusual significance?
The game appears fake, but we cannot call it that without revealing
something else, another scene that is not usually hidden and is surely
known to all ethnologists, even if they make no direct mention of it. By
suggesting that the game of the Ases is fake, without explaining his
meaning, G. Dumezil could be said to be speaking about the scene in­
directly. It is clearly a question of collective violence. If Baldr were not
invulnerable he would obviously not survive the treatment inflicted on
him by the Ases; the very event Baldr fears, and is feared by all the Ases,
will obviously take place. Baldr will perish, like so many gods, the vic­
tim of collective murder. There is nothing to distinguish the myth of
Baldr from the countless myths in which collective murder provides the
central drama.
We are surprised by the myth precisely because it adds nothing
truly original or unexpected, and the game seems fake because it resem­
bles so exactly the most frequently found and hackneyed scene in all
mythology, collective murder. The convention of an invulnerable Baldr
merely transforms the representation of a murder into an inoffensive
game. Is this a simple coincidence, an accidental similarity? The
sequence proves it is not. To understand the myth's close relationship to
other myths that contain collective murder we must proceed to the end of
this seemingly inoffensive game of the Ases and determine whether the
final consequences would be the same had the game been played for
real. Baldr falls, struck dead by one of the gods who are supposed to
remain innocent of the deed even though, in the end, they truly cause
his death.
What has happened? We shall learn as we read on in Mythe et epopee.
There is one god or, rather, one demon, Loki, the trickster or cheat of
Scandinavian mythology, who does not join in the make-believe game
and tries to break it up. Faithful to his sources, G. Dumezil writes, "This
spectacle displeased Loki?' The feigned lynching of Baldr arouses
strong reactions among all the spectators, displeasure in Loki, and
astonishment in Dumezil. And it is the fault of Loki, as always, that the
feigned lynching of Baldr, the childish game of the Ases, ultimately
brings about the same consequence as an actual lynching.

68

T H E SCAPEG 0AT

The Scandinavian trickster disguises himself a s a woman and goes to Frigg to
ask whether there is any exception to the universal oath not to harm Baldr. And
he learns from Frigg that a young sh oot of mistilteinn (mistletoe) had seemed so
young to her that she had not asked it to take the oath. Loki takes the sh oot,
returns to the thing [the sacred spot where the lynching will take place] and gives
it to Baldr's blind brother, Hoehr, who had refrained from hitting his brother
until then because he could not see him. Loki guides his hand toward the victim
who is assassinated by a simple twig of mistletoe.

Loki's treachery thus cancels the effect of the measures taken by the
gods to "protect" Baldr from all violence. Why does this myth take such
a strange and circuitous route to arrive at almost the same result as thou­
sands of other myths, the violent death of a god struck by other gods, his
companions who are all joined against him. Since the result is so famil­
iar why not take the familiar route to it? The only feasible or even con­
ceivable response seems to be that the version of the myth we are
analyzing is not the first. It must stem from older versions in which
Baldr is the victim of the most banal and classic of all collective
murders. It must be the work of people who cannot tolerate the tradi­
tional representation of the murder because it makes all the gods, the
victim aside, into criminals. The original gathering of gods is no differ­
ent from a band of assassins, and in a sense the faithful want none of it
but they have no other sacred text; they cling to it; they are passionately
attached to their religious representations. They want to keep these
representations but they also want to get rid of them or, rather, to over­
throw them in an effort to eliminate that essential stereotype of persecu­
tion, collective murder. The effort to reconcile the two imperatives
results in myths, such as Baldr's that are so curiously structured.
The answer lies in the idea that the ancestors saw clearly what there
was to see in the primordial epiphany but imerpreted it wrongly. Naive
and uncivilized as they were, they did not understand the subtlety of
what was happening. They believed it was collective murder, falling
into the trap set by the demon Loki, the only real assassin and deceiver.
Loki becomes the unique receptacle for the violence that was formerly
shared by all the lynchers, but which clearly becomes perverse when it
is concentrated within a single individual. The reputation of the loner,
Loki, is sacrificed for the rehabilitation of all the other gods. The choice
of Loki is paradoxical if, as it would seem, he really was the only one of
all the gods in the originial scene who does not join in the lynching.
This would seem to suppose a manipulation of the myth to the

A SE S, CU RE TE S, AND TI TANS

69

moral detriment of a single god for the benefit of all the others. There
are several other small indications of the desire to clear the original mur­
derers of guilt such as the strange way in which Baldr is actually put to
death. All the details of the incident are clearly meant to remove any
trace of responsibility from the person who is most likely to be seen as
the criminal, since it is by his hand- he is even called handbam·, or one
who kills by hand, elsewhere in the myth-that Baldr dies. Presumably,
in collective murder not all the participants are equally guilty; if the
person who deals the fatal blow can be identified, as in this case, then
he unquestionably bears the greater responsibility. The myth must take
exceptional measures to prove the innocence of Hoehr, since obviously
he is the most guilty, having dealt the blow. Greater effort is needed to
prove his innocence than for all the other gods put together.
Once this is understood the other details of the murder become
clear. In the first place, Hoehr is blind: "He had until then refrained
from striking his brother because he could not see him?' For him to
touch his brother someone has to guide his hand toward the target; Loki
of course obliges. Hoehr has no reason to believe that his blow might kill
Baldr. Like the other gods he believes that his brother is invulnerable to
all conceivable weapons and projectiles. He is even further reassured by
the object that Loki puts in his hand, which is extremely light and too
insignificant to be considered a fatal weapon. Even the most anxious and
concerned of brothers for the well-being and security of his brother
could not foresee the terrible consequences of Hoehr's action. In other
words the myth heaps on the excuses in an effort to prove Hoehr's inno­
cence. In place of the simple denial that is sufficient for the other gods,
Hoehr's responsibility is denied on at least three successive occasions.
Each time it is Loki who bears the brunt ofit. Three times guilty of the
murder of which he is technically innocent, Loki cynically manipulates
the unfortunate Hoehr who on each of the three occasions is innocent
of the murder for which he alone is technically to blame.
If you try too hard to prove something you prove nothing. This is
the case in the myth of Baldr: guilty people make too many excuses.
They fail to realize that a simple excuse is more effective than many
excellent ones. If you want to deceive your audience you had better not
let them see what you are trying to do. Too great an effort to hide some­
thing always reveals the deception. The intention becomes more obvi­
ous because it removes everything that might distract and immediately
reveals the hidden object. Nothing is likely to arouse suspicion more

70

THE SCAPEGOAT

than the many elements of irresponsibility that are heaped strangely on
the head of the real culprit.
It is clearly possible to interpret the myth of Baldr by explaining
absolutely every detail, relying on the simplest and most economical
principle, but it is only possible by seeking that principle in an aversion
to the representation of a collective murder. The myth is clearly ob­
sessed and completely determined by this representation that neverthe­
less does not figure explicitly among its themes. Mythologists do not
perceive this aversion because they do not realize the importance of col­
lective murders in mythology. Once we realize this importance, all the
enigmatic aspects of our particular myth, and of many others, begin to
make sense . . . they make even more sense, of course, in the context of
the many Germanic myths that contain a collective murder in its classi­
cal form. We might be wise to listen to myths, especially when they con­
tradict ideas that we take for granted.
It remains to prove that the myth of Baldr is not an aberration or
exception in mythology. Similarities are to be found not everywhere but
in enough important traditions that are both too close to what we have
just studied in probable intent yet too different in the solution
adopted- the thematic content of the version that has come down to
us- not to reinforce the concept that a stage of development and adapta­
tion in their evolution may exist in which the significance of "collective
murder" is effaced. This desire to obliterate is remarkable because it is
usually associated with a religious conservatism that is anxious to keep
earlier representations intact, although their object could only be collec­
tive murder.
I shall now turn to a second example taken, this time, from Greek
mythology: the birth of Zeus. The god, Kronos, is devouring all his
children and is looking for his last-born, Zeus, whom Rhea, the mother,
has hidden from him. The Curetes, fierce warriors, hide the baby by
forming a circle around him. The cries of the terrified baby Zeus could
lead his father to his hiding-place. To drown out his crying and deceive
the devouring monster, the Curetes clash their weapons and behave in
as noisy and threatening a way as possible.2 The more frightened the
baby becomes, the shriller his cries, and the more the Curetes, in order
to protect him, must behave in a way that frightens him. The more

71

actual reassurance and protection they provide, the more frightening
they appear. It looks as if they are forming a circle around the baby to
kill him, whereas they are actually saving his life.
Again, collective violence is absent from this myth, but not in the
same way a thousand other things are absent that have not even been
considered. Its absence is similar but not identical to the absence I have
just analyzed in the myth of Baldr. The situation involving the infant
Zeus is clear, but the configuration and behavior of the Curetes are
reminiscent of collective murder. What else would we imagine listening
to the wild cries and the brandishing of weapons in the direction of a
defenseless creature? If this were a spectacle without words, a living
tableau, we would not hestitate to give it the meaning that the myth
denies. Like the fake game of the Ases, or the suicide of the Aztecs, the
playacting of the Curetes and the frightened reaction ofthe infant come
as close as one could conceive to the drama that statistically dominates
world mythology. Yet this myth and that of Baldr assure us that the
resemblance is an illusion.
Both myths give the group of murderers the role of "protector" in
order to eliminate the violent significance of the scene. But the similar­
ity ends there. In the Scandinavian myth the collective murder that is
presented as unreal has the same consequences as if it were real. It has
no consequence in the Greek myth. The dignity of Zeus is incompatible
with his death at the hands of the Curetes. I imagine there is an earlier
version of this myth, too, that contains collective murder. In the
metamorphosis the murder has disappeared without modifying, or
modifying extensively, the representations that suggest it. The problem
is the same, but the Greek solution is both more elegant and more radi­
cal than the Scandinavian solution. It succeeds in giving the lynching
scene, the circle around the victim, the significance of a protective role.
The Scandinavian myth, as we have seen, has no other recourse but to
represent it as a game that even observers who reject the concept of col­
lective murder recognize as "fake" or, in other words, as possessing an­
other meaning.
The two solutions are too original for one myth to have influenced
the other. Here we have two religious thoughts pursuing not exactly the
same but very similar objectives at a similar stage in their evolution. Be­
fore such evidence there can be no question about the evolution of
mythology, or rather successive stages of evolution limited to a small
number of religious traditions.

72

THE SCAPEGOAT

Like the myth ofBaldr the myth o fthe Curetes must originate with
interpreters who are genuinely convinced that they have received their
mythological tradition in an altered form. In their eyes collective mur­
der is too scandalous to be authentic. They do not consider it a falsifica­
tion of the text when they reinterpret that scene in their own fashion.
They consider the transmission of the myth at fault. Instead of faith·
fully reporting the tradition handed down to them, their forefathers
must have corrupted it because they could not understand it. In this
myth, too, the violence that was formerly shared by many is attributed
to one god only, Kronos, who as a result of this transference becomes
truly monstrous. This sort of caricature is unusual in myths that portray
collective murder. There is a certain sharing ofgood and evil: moral du­
alism appears as collective violence is eliminated. The fact that evil is at­
tributed to a god of the preceding generation in Olympian mythology no
doubt reflects the negative opinion held by a new religious sensibility of
the representation it transforms.
My interpretation of the myth of Zeus and the Curetes is entirely
based on an absence, the absence of collective murder. I have treated the
absence of murder as a given even though it is of course speculative,
even more than in the case of Baldr, since Zeus is spared and there are
no consequences of collective murder. Although strengthened by the
similarity of the two myths, my interpretation ofthe Greek myth is cer­
tainly weaker than that of the Scandinavian myth. For support it needs
the discovery of a second myth, in its own general category, which
would be closely similar to it but different in that the collective murder
of the infimt god would not have been eliminated. The scene that has
been so cleverly transfigured in the myth of the Curetes would be left to
exist in the fullness of its original sense. The chances of there really be­
ing a transfiguration, and of my interpretation being accurate, would be
considerably increased. Is this too much to ask? Of course not. There is
a myth in Greek mythology that is homologous to that of the Curetes ex­
cept in one point: it contains collective violence that is directed against
an infant god; it still retains the sense that is clearly lacking in the case
of the Curetes. Let's put it to the test:
In order to attract the young Dionysus into their circle, the Titans
shake a kind of rattle. Fascinated by the brilliant objects, the child ad­
vances toward them, and the monstrous circle closes around him. Al­
together, the Titans assassinate Dionysus; after which they roast and eat

A S E S , C U R E TE S , AND T I TANS

73

him. Zeus, father of Dionysus, destroys the Titans and revives his son.3
Between the Curetes and the Titans most of the significance is reversed.
The father is a protector among the Titans, destructive and cannibalis­
tic among the Curetes. The group in the myth of the Titans is destruc­
tive and cannibalistic; in the myth ofCuretes the group is protective. In
both myths objects are shaken in front of the child. In the myth of the
Titans they seem harmless but are deadly; among the Curetes they seem
deadly but are in fact harmless.
Mythology is a game of transformations. Levi-Strauss has made a
most important contribution in revealing this. But the ethnologists
believe -wrongly, I think- that the passage can be interpreted in any
way. Everything is on the same level. Nothing essential is ever either
lost or gained. The arrows of time do not exist. The inadequacy of this
concept can be clearly seen. Our two myths are clearly transformations
of each other; as I have just shown. After shuffling his cards, the magi­
cian spreads them out again in a different order. At first we have the im­
pression that they are all there, but is it true? Ifwe look closer we shall
see that there is flCtually always one missing, and it is always the same
one, the representation ofcollective murder. Everything that happens is
of less importance than this disappearance, and to see everything else is
to see what is not essential. Moreover, it is impossible to penetrate un­
less the secret design to which it responds is understood.
Structural analysis rests on the single principle of differentiated bi­
nary opposition. It does not allow for the identification of the extreme
importance for mythology of the "all against one" of collective violence.
Structuralism perceives it as one among many oppositions and traces it
to a common law. It attaches no particular significance to the existing
representation of violence, and therefore certainly not to its absence. It
is too rudimentary a method of analysis to understand what has been
lost in the course of a transformation such as I have just described.
When the magician shuffles the cards long enough and displays them in
a different order he is preventing us from thinking about what has disap­
p eared, and makes us forget the disappearance if we happened to have
noticed it. The magician of mythologies and religions has a very good
audience in our structuralists.
Identifying the disappearance of collective murder in the passage

T H E S C A P EG O A T

from the myth ofthe Titans to the myth of the Curetes brings the under­
standing that this type of transformation can only be brought about in
the one way I have indicated. Collective murder may certainly disappear
from mythology. It does in fact nothing else; but once gone it cannot
reappear, it will not spring, fully armed, from some pure combination,
like Minerva from the head of Zeus. Once a myth has been transformed
from its Titan form to that of Baldr or of the Curetes, it never returns
to its former state; that would be inconceivable. There is, in other words,
a history of mythology. This fact can be acknowledged without the dan·
ger of the old illusions of historicism. The necessary historical, or di­
achronic, stages result from a purely textual and "structural" analysis.
Mythology eliminates collective murder but does not reinvent it, be­
cause all evidence indicates it was not invented in the first place.
None of this is meant to imply that the myth of the Curetes
originates in the myth of the Titans or that it is the transformation of
that myth rather than another. A closer look at the myth of the Titans
reveals a correspondence to a religious vision that is perhaps not so
different from that of the myth of Zeus. And if it had retained the
representation of collective murder, this myth also would have been the
object of a certain manipulation. There is to be found in it, always to
Zeus's advantage, the same division between good and evil as in the myth
of the Curetes. Collective violence persists but is declared evil akin to
cannibalism. As in the myth of the Curetes violence is attributed to an
older mythological generation and to a religious system now seen to be
"barbarous" and "primitive?'
Children and naive people experience a feeling offear and revulsion
when confronted with the myth of the Titans. Ethnologists today would
say that they allow themselves to be dominated by the affectivity. I
myselfhave lapsed into an affective ethnology entirely absorbed by a sen·
timental lack of coherence or so they say. Like the realist novelists of the
mid-nineteenth century our human scientists identify cold humanity
and impassivity as the most fitting state of mind in which to acquire
scientific knowledge. The mathematical exactitude of the so-called hard
sciences arouses an admiration that all too often takes the metaphor of
hardness too literally. Research disdains sentiments that cannot be
ignored without risk since they play an essential role in the very object
being studied, in this case the mythological text. Even if the analysis of
"structures" can be kept completely separated from affectivity there is
still no point to maintaining that separation. The sentiments scorned by

AS ES, CURET ES, AND TITANS

75

ethnology must be considered if we are to understand the secret behind
the transformation of the myths in our two examples. Feigning tough­
ness in order not to be disarmed is in fact to give up one's best weapons.
The real triumphs over mythology have nothing in common with
this feigned impassiveness. They belong to an earlier period when the
aim pursued was purely moral. They are the anonymous work of those
early critics of the witch-hunts and persecutions by intolerant mobs.
Even in a purely formal reading that retained all the strong points of
today's school, a successful interpretation would not be possible without
taking into account either collective murder, wherever it is present, or
the uneasiness caused by its disappearance: all the images are arranged
around its absence. Unless we recognize this uneasiness, even those
aspects relating stn"ctly to the combination and transformation of the rela­
tionships among certain myths must remain hidden.

CHAPTER SEVEN

The Crimes of the Gods
'filE EVOLUTION OF mythology is governed by the determination to elim­
inate any representation of violence. To gain a clearer understanding we
must follow the process beyond the stage, just defined, in which only col­
lective violence is at work. Each time it disappears it is replaced by
individual violence. There may be a second stage, especially in Greek
and Roman mythology, in which even individual violence is suppressed,
so that all forms of violence in mythology become unacceptable. Those
who go beyond this stage, whether they know it or not-and it would
seem that usually they do not- are all pursuing the same goal: the elimi­
nation of the very last traces of collective murder, the elimination of
traces of traces, so to speak. Plato's attitude provides a significant exam­
ple of this new stage. His intention to remove any trace of mythological
violence is quite explicit in the Republic. This is especially noticeable in
the character of Kronos in a text that is particularly relevant to my
analysis:

and then there is the tale ofKronos's doings and of his son's treatment of him.
Even if such tales were true, I should not have supposed they should be lightly
told to thoughtless young people. If they cannot be altogether suppressed, they
should only be revealed in a mystery, to which access should be as far as possible
restricted by requiring the sacrifice, not of a pig, but of some victim such as very
1
few could afford. It is true: those stories are objectionable.

Clearly, it is not collective murder that shocks Plato, since it has dis­
appeared, but the individual violence that has taken its place.

P ress), 378 a-b.

THE CRIMES OF THE GODS

77

The determination to eliminate all violence, by its very explicitness,
becomes a form of censorship, a deliberate mutilation of the mytho­
logical text. It no longer has the force of structural reorganization and
the extraordinary coherence it possessed in the preceding stage, and
therefore does not succeed in modifying the mythological text. Plato
foresaw that failure and proposed a kind of compromise mixed with the
most interesting religious precautions. The recommendation that the
sacrificial victim should be ofsignifi,cance and value is not merely moti­
vated by the desire to reduce to the minimum the number of witnesses
to the misdeeds of Kronos and Zeus. This recommendation is to be ex­
pected, within the context of a religion in which sacrifice still existed,
from a sincerely religious person confronted with a violence that he feels
may be contaminating. A similar but legitimate and sacred form ofvio­
lence is needed as a counterbalance, and is found in the sacrifice of as
important a victim as possible. Thus in Plato's text the circle of violence
and the sacred is almost explicitly closed before our very eyes.
The censorship that Plato demanded was never imposed in the way
he imagined; but it was imposed and still is imposed today in a different
and more effective form, incorporated in the discipline of ethnology.
The Platonic stage, as opposed to the preceding one, does not culminate
in an actual re-creation of the myth, though it is just as fundamental.
Another culture is founded, no longer truly mythological but "rational"
and "philosophical;' forming the very text of philosophy. Mythology is
condemned by many ancient writers, generally in the trite forms taken
from Plato which illustrate well the true nature of the scandal. Varro, for
example, talks of a "theology of the poets" which he found particularly
annoying because it asks the faithful to admire "thieving and adulterous
gods, gods who are slaves of a man; in other words all man's pitfalls are
attributed to the gods, even the most despicable:'2
According to Varro what Plato calls the theology of the poets is that
very primitive dual quality of the sacred which unites blessed with
cursed. All the passages from Homer criticized by Plato show the evil
aspects of divinity as well as the good. Plato's wish for differentiation
does not permit moral ambiguity in the divine. Exactly the same can be
seen today in Levi-Strauss and in structuralism, except that Plato's
moral grandeur has disappeared and been replaced by a certain linguisti2. Quoted by Georges Dumezil, La Religion romaine archai4ue (Paris: Payot, 1966),
p. 108.

78

cal and logical concern, a philosophy o fthe mixture that is impossible
because it does not conform to the ''laws of language and thought?' The
idea that men might not always think in exactly the same way never
occurs. Dionysius of Halicarnassus also complains of myths that pre­
sent gods as "wicked, evildoers, indecent, unworthy of honest people,
never mind divine beings . . ?' In fact all these ancient authors share the
premonition that their gods may become the despised and trampled
victims of men. This is what they must prevent. They reject the possi­
bility in horror, for, unlike the prophets of the Jews and then the
Gospels, they cannot imagine that such a victim could be innocent.
Plato openly condemns mythology and deflects it from its tradi­
tional themes. His text is full of the sort of motifs mentioned earlier in
explanation of the disappearance of collective murder from the myth of
the Curetes. The first transformations date from a prephilosophical
stage and evolved from the original myths. We have no other evidence
aside from these transformed myths, which become immediately com­
prehensible when they are understood to be the result of transformation.
Plato's philosophical decree is thus not the result of individual whim
but reveals retroactively the evolution of all mythology. Plato clearly
had both recent and distant predecessors who were involved in cleaning
up myths, but they all worked mythologically, within the framework
of mythology and traditional religion, transforming mythological
narrative.
The stereotype of violence to which the gods and heroes were sub­
jected is first weakened by the loss of its brutally and spectacularly col­
lective character and then almost entirely disappears as it becomes a sort
of individual violence. Other stereotypes of persecution undergo com­
parable evolutions and for the same reasons. Men who cannot tolerate
the collective murder of a god would be equally shocked by the crimes
that justify the murder. The texts I have quoted show that the two go
together. Varro complains of the poets who attribute to the gods all man's
weaknesses, particularly those of the most despised of men. The poets, of
course, are not responsible for the attribution since it is found every­
where in mythology. Even then, as today, the "poets;' the interpreters of
the preceding period, provide the best available scapegoats, and the
betrayals of which they are accused in turn bring about further
censorship.
From now on gods must be neither criminals nor victims and,
because they are not recognized as scapegoats, their acts of violence and

THE CRIMES O F THE GODS

79

criminality- the signs that point to them as victims- including the
crisis itself, must be gradually eliminated. Sometimes the meaning of
the crisis is inverted, and the lack of distinction between gods and men
is endowed with the utopian sense to which I have alluded.
As a community moves away from its violent origins, the sense of
ritual weakens and moral dualism is reinforced. Gods and their deeds,
even the most evil, served originally as models in the rites. On impor­
tant ritual occasions religions make a place for disorder, though always
in subordination to order. There comes a time, however, when men
want only models of morality and demand gods purified of all faults.
The complaints of Plato should not be taken lightly, nor those of
Euripides, who also wanted to reform the gods. They reflect the disin­
tegration of the primitive notion of the sacred, the tendency toward
dualism that only wants to retain the beneficent aspect of the gods. This
leads to the development of an ideology that consists either in transfer­
ring the sacred to demons, in order to distinguish them more and more
from the gods, as in the Brahman religion, or in belittling or nullifying
evil, implying that it was added to an earlier religion which alone con­
forms to the ideal of the reformer. In fact, the reformer is creating an
origin by relegating his ideal to a purely imaginary past. By this act of
relegation he transfigures the original crisis into an idyll and a utopia.
The conflict that results from the absence of distinction becomes a
happy resolution.
The tendency to idealize transforms or effaces all the stereotypes:
the crisis, the signs that indicate a victim, collective violence, and of
course the victim's crime. This can be seen clearly in the myth ofBaldr.
The god who is not collectively killed cannot be a guilty god. He is a god
whose crime has been completely effaced, a perfectly sublime god,
devoid of all fault. It is no accident that the two stereotypes are sup­
pressed simultaneously; this results from a single inspiration on the part
of the faithful. The punishment and its cause are connected and must
disappear together, since the reason for their disappearance is the same.
Am I right in insisting that something has been actively eliminated
and that this is more than a pure and simple absence? I proved it in the
case ofcollective murder, but the argument only related indirectly to the
crime that I assumed was originally attributed to all the gods. I implied
that an original "criminal" Baldr must have existed in a more primitive
version of the myth. As we have seen, the myth ofBaldr contains all that
is necessary to confirm the tremendous relevance of the collective

80

T H E SCAPEGOAT

murder that is absent, and thereby the manipulation of that murder in
the version handed down to us. This does not quite hold true for the
crime that is also absent. In order to prove that the stereotypes of perse­
cution are truly universal we must demonstrate their great relevance for
myths, particularly those that do not contain them.
Take first the stereotype ofthe crime. The study of myths suggests
that there was a very strong tendency, especially in Greek mythology, to
minimize and even suppress the crimes ofthe gods long before Plato and
the philosophers articulated the concept. Even a superficial reading will
reveal immediately that myths cannot be divided into two categories
according to divine misdoing: guilty gods on the one hand and innocent
gods on the other. There are a multitude of variations between the two,
forming a continuum from the most atrocious crimes to perfect
innocence by way of unimportant mistakes, blunders, and carelessness,
which, however, have just as disastrous consequences as the most seri­
ous crimes.
This range cannot be looked on as static. Its evolutionary character
becomes clear when we notice how many themes clearly share one
feature in common: the wish to minimize and excuse a fault. The literal
definition of the fault always remains the same, but we are left with so
different an impression even today that the fundamental identity of all
these crimes is not apparent. The Olympian gods of classical Greece are
no longer victims, as we have seen, but they still commit most of the
stereotypical crimes that would justify putting the guilty person to
death in other mythologies. Their actions, however, are treated so
favorably, with so much indulgence and refinement, that their effect on
us today is very different from our reaction to them in so-called ethno­
logical myths.
When Zeus turns into a swan to become Leda's lover we do not
think of the crime ofbestiality, when the Minotaur marries Pasiphae we
think nothing ofit, or at most consider the author in bad taste; yet there
is no difference between these two myths and the Dogrib myth of the
woman-dog or even the horrible medieval fiction of the Jewish woman
ofBinzwangen giving birth to a litter of pigs. We react to the same fables
in different ways, depending on whether we see in them, or are made to
see in them, the results of persecution. Aesthetic and poetic treatment
lends itself to a million and one ways of elaborating on the stereotypes
of persecution or of concealing anything that might reveal the original
scapegoat mechanism that created the text.

THE CRIMES OF THE GODS

81

Plato, like all Puritans, misses the goal, which is t o reveal the mech­
anism of the victim and the demystification of the representations of
persecution. But at least he has more greatness and depth than the
morally lax poets or the aesthetes among contemporary critics who dis­
solve the essential of the problematic. Plato not only objects to attribut­
ing all the typical crimes to the gods, he is also opposed to the poetic
treatment of those crimes so that they appear to be no more than minor
faults, simple escapades, and trivial pranks.
The Aristotelian notion of "hamartia" conceptualizes the poetic
minimization of the crime. It suggests simple negligence, a fault by
omission rather than the fullness of evil of the ancient myths. The
"tragic flaw" of the translation evokes a very minor fault, a single chink
in a homogeneous mass ofirreproachable virtue. The baleful dimension
of the sacred is still present, though reduced to a minimum, just as it is
logically indispensable to the justification of the invariably disastrous
consequences. This is a long way from the myths in which good and evil
are balanced. Most of the so-called primitive myths have come down to
us in that first stage ofbalance, and past ethnology has rightly classified
them primitive; it senses their affinity to the scapegoat mechanism on
which they are based and which achieves results through a successful
projection of all evil.
If the crime is not to be completely obliterated in an attempt to
excuse the god - something that Plato openly called for- then an endur­
ing force is needed which would treat the traditional text with extreme
respect. Only the prolonged effect of the scapegoat can achieve this,
with the logic that belongs to the ritual and sacrificial phase ofprimitive
religion. The god incarnates the scourge, as I said earlier; he is this side
of good and evil, not beyond them. The difference he incarnates is not
yet defined in terms of moral distinctions; the victim's transcendence
has not yet been fragmented into a good and divine power on one side
and a bad demoniacal power on the other.
It is inevitable that this division will take place as a result of all the
different pressures brought to bear on the original mythical collection.
From the moment ofdivision the balance in myths is broken, sometimes
in favor of the evil, sometimes in favor of the good, sometimes in both
directions at once. In this case the ambiguous primitive god is split into
a perfectly good hero and a perfectly bad monster who ravages the com­
munity: Oedipus and the sphinx, Saint George and the dragon, the
water snake of the Arawak myth and the liberator who kills him. The

82

THE SCAPEGOAT

monster inherits all that is detestable in the episode, the crisis, the crime,
the criteria for choosing a victim, the first three stereotypes of persecu­
tion. The hero incarnates the fourth stereotype only: murder, the sacri­
ficial decision, which is all the more clearly liberating because fully
justified by the evil of violence of the monster.
This type of division evidently occurs at a late stage since it is found
in fairy tales and legends, mythical forms which have degenerated to
such a degree that they are no longer the object of truly religious belief.
Let us turn back.
It is not a question of an immediate suppression of the god's crime.
If censored carelessly, it would eliminate one problem only to create
another. Religious adapters of myths are more perceptive than ethnolo­
gists and understand clearly that the violence inflicted on their god is
justified by a fault he committed previously. If this justification is elimi­
nated purely and simply, then the most sacred character in the myth is
exonerated, but the community that punished him, deprived of its justi­
fication, then becomes criminal. This community of murderers is
almost as sacred as the original victim, for it engenders the community
of the tilithful. The attempt to moralize myths ends in a dilemma. We
can easily deduce this dilemma from primordial mythic themes, but we
can also read the results clearly in more developed texts. The frequently
subtle nuances of divine culpability which have been incomprehensible
until now suddenly appear to be rather ingenious solutions invented by
the tilithful throughout the ages, and myths simultaneously designed to
free all the actors in the sacred drama of blame.
The simplest solution is to retain the victim's crimes but claim they
were not intended. The victim did indeed do what he is accused of, but
he did not do it intentionally. Oedipus killed his father and went to bed
with his mother, but he thought he was doing something else. No one
in fact is to blame, and all the moral exigencies are satisfied with respect
to almost all of the traditional text. At a critical stage of their evolution,
or rather of their interpretation, myths frequently reveal innocent cul­
prits, like Oedipus, juxtaposed with communities that are innocently
guilty.
The situation is somewhat similar in the case of the Scandinavian
god Hoehr, analyzed earlier. Although he is physically responsible for
the murder of the noble Baldr, he is, if anything, even more innocent
than Oedipus. There are many good reasons why he sees his murderous
action as only a harmless imitation or an amusing parody with no

THE CRIMES O F THE GODS

83

untoward consequences for his brother, the target at which he is aiming.
Hoehr has absolutely no way of anticipating what will happen.
Thus the primitive gods, who are fully guilty, are succeeded by gods
of limited or even nonexistent culpability. The absolution, however, is
never truly universal. The elimination of the fault in one place generally
means its reappearance somewhere else, usually on the periphery and in
an exacerbated form. Thus we see a god or a kind of demon appear who
is even more guilty, a Loki or a Kronos who plays the role of a secondary
scapegoat. Although this is a textual creation it nevertheless constitutes
a trace of the real victim.
There are other ways of reducing the guilt of the gods without at­
tributing it to a violent community and above all without revealing the
mechanism of the scapegoat which can never be revealed. Victims are
introduced who are guilty of the actions without being intrinsically bad.
Because they have not been informed of certain circumstances, they
bring about unintentionally the state of affairs required to justify the use
of collective violence against them. This is really only a variation of the
crime without criminal intention.
The supreme form of this double justification can be found in the
interaction of the victim with the community of killers in terms of pure
and simple misunderstanding and communication wrongly interpreted.
It also happens that the crimes of the gods are seen as real, but they
are given, in the myths, a subsidiary reason such as a natural but irresist­
ible force which compels the god to evil action without his wanting any
part of it. He may be made to take an intoxicating drink, or be stung by
a poisonous insect. This is a summary of what Eliade wrote in his His­
tory of Religious Ideas about a Hittite god stung by a bee:
Because the beginning of the story has been lost we do not know why Telipinu
decides to "disappear'� . . But the results of his disappearance are immediately
felt. Hearth fires are extinguished, gods and men feel "overwhelmed"; the sheep
forsakes her lamb and the cow her calf; "the barley and com no longer ripen;'
animals and men couple no longer; pastures grow barren and springs dry
up . . . . Finally the mother-goddess sends the bee; it finds the god sleeping in a
wood and wakes him with a sting. In his fury Telipinu provokes such calamities
on the country that the gods are afraid and resort to magic to calm him. Telipinu
is purged of anger and of"evil" by magic formulae and ceremonies. Finally pac­
ified he returns to the gods- and life resumes its normal rhythm.3

THE SCAP EGOAT

Two of the stereotypes of persecution are very much i n evidence:
the crisis and the guilt of the god who precipitates the crisis. Divine
responsibility is both increased and diminished by the bee sting. Instead
of collective violence directly reversing evil into good, this is its ritual
equivalent. The magic action nevertheless signifies that violence; it
always tries to reproduce the original effect of the scapegoat, and it is
always collective in nature. All the other gods are afraid and intervene
against Telipinu to put an end to his destructive actions. But the vio­
lence of this intervention is hidden; the gods are no more enemies of
Telipinu than Telipinu is really the enemy of the people. There is dis­
order in the community and the cause ofit is divine, but there is no truly
bad intention on the part of anyone, neither in Telipinu's relationship
with the people nor in the other gods' relationship with Telipinu.
We should include among the variations on the theme of the
minimized fault the actions of the North American trickster and all the
"deceiving" gods found everywhere. These gods are as much scapegoats
as the others. All their good deeds stem from a social pact formed at the
expense of the victim. They are always preceded by actions clearly per­
ceived as wrong and justly punished. Again, this is the paradox of the
god who is helpful because he is harmful, a force of order because he
creates disorder. As long as the mythological representation of persecu­
tion remains intact there are bound to be questions about the intentions
of the gods. Why should a god put those he wants to help and protect
into such difficulties; moreover, why does he put himself in that posi­
tion? Apart from the gods who do evil unwittingly and the gods who are
forced irresistibly to do evil, there is inevitably a third solution, the god
who enjoys doing evil and is amused by it. Although he always helps in
the end, he is delighted when things go badly and continues to enjoy it.
He is known for his games. He pushes his playfulness so far that he loses
control of the consequences. He is the sorcerer's apprentice who sets fire
to the world by lighting a very small flame and who drowns the earth
with his urine. Thus he justifies every effort to correct and, by virtue of
these efforts, he is transformed into a benefactor.
The trickster is sometimes seen as wicked, but sometimes he is so
stupid and clumsy in carrying out his mission that accidents happen,
whether he wants them to or not. These both compromise the desired
result and yet ensure its outcome by creating the unanimous opposition
to the blunderer necessary for the good of the community.
We must recognize in the trickster one of the two great theologies to

T HE CRIMES 0 F T H E G 0 DS

85

evolve as a result of the sacralization of the scapegoat: the theology of
divine capn"ce. The other theology is divine anger, which provides still
another solution to the problem that faces religious belief when the vic­
tim whom it thinks is truly guilty becomes the means of reconciliation.
If those who benefited from the mechanism were able to challenge the
scapegoat's responsibility, there would be no reconciliation and no
divinity.
In this perspective the god is fundamentally good but is temporarily
transformed into a wicked god. He crushes the faithful in order to bring
them back to the straight path; he corrects their weaknesses which pre­
vent him from immediately showing his beneficence. He who loves
greatly punishes greatly. This solution, though less happy than the
preceding one, is more profound in that it introduces the rare idea
among men that their scapegoat is not the only incarnation of violence.
The community shares the responsibility for evil with the god; it begins
to be guilty of its own disorders. The theology of anger comes very close
to the truth, but it is still closely tied to the representation of persecu­
tion. The solution lies in an analysis of the scapegoat mechanism which
will untie the knot that keeps the mythological representation closed
within itself.
To conclude this discussion of the guilt of the god and to show that
we need not divide the solutions into rigid categories, I would like to dis­
cuss a myth that is found in very different parts of the world and that
ingeniously manages to combine all the advantages from which the
above solutions had to choose.
Cadmus, the ancestor of all Theban mythology, after killing the
dragon, sows the dragon's teeth in the earth, from which armed warriors
immediately spring up. This new menace, born of the previous one,
clearly illustrates the relationship between the crisis of persecution
within human communities on the one hand, and all the dragons and
fabled beasts on the other. Cadmus resorts to a very simple ruse to rid
himself of the warriors. Surreptitiously he picks up a pebble and throws
it into the middle of the troop. It hits none of the warriors, but the noise
of the fall makes each one think the other has provoked him; in a
moment they are at each other's throats and kill each other to the last
man. Cadmus is seen here as a kind of tn"ckster. In one sense he causes
the social crisis, the great disorder that ravages a group of men to the
point of complete destruction. In itself his action is not outrageous, the
pebble did not hurt anyone; the trick only becomes truly wicked

86

T HE SCAPEG0AT

because of the stupid brutality of the warriors and their blind tendency
to react antagonistically. An evil reciprocity feeds and exasperates the
conflict all the more quickly in that the participants are unaware of it.
This myth reveals in a spectacular way how reciprocity, as discussed
earlier, eliminates differences as it accelerates and takes over societies in
crisis. But the wondrous thing is that it implicitly reveals both the justi­
fication for the scapegoat and the explanation of his effectiveness. Once
set in motion, the mechanism ofevil reciprocity can only become worse
for the very reason that all the harm which does not exist at that precise
moment is about to become real. At least half of the combatants always
believe that justice has been done since they have been avenged, while
the other half try to reestablish that same justice by striking those who
are provisionally satisfied with a blow that will finally achieve their
vengeance. The circumstances are so confused that they will only be
brought to an end by both sides recognizing the evil reciprocity. It is ask­
ing too much to expect them to understand that the relationships within
the group not only feed their misfortune but generate it. A community
may pass from good to evil reciprocity for petty reasons, but the reasons
may be so powerful and convincing that it amounts to the same thing.
Everyone is more or less equally responsible but no one will admit it.
Even if men were truly aware of their evil reciprocity they would still
want to identify the author, a real and punishable source; they might
allow that his role was less significant, but they would still want an origi­
nal cause which could be rectified, as Evans-Pritchard writes, a pertinent
cause on the plane of social relationships.
It is easy to understand why and how the mechanism of the scape­
goat can sometimes interrupt this process. The blind instinct for
reprisals, the stupid recriprocity which pits each one against the nearest
or most visible adversary, is not based on anything specific; thus every­
thing can converge at almost any time, on almost anyone, but preferably
at the moment of greatest hysteria. Something must trigger the inci­
dent, either accidentally or by some sign that points to a victim. A possi­
ble target need only be slightly more attractive than others for the whole
group suddenly to come together in total agreement without the slight­
est feeling of doubt or contradiction . . . . Since in such cases there is
never any reason for violence except everyone's belief in that other
reason, it is enough for everyone to focus on that other reality, the scape­
goat, who then becomes everyone's "other." The intervention no longer
seems to be, but is effective, by simply extinguishing all possible desire

THE CRIMES O F THE GODS

87

for reprisals among the survivors. Only the scapegoat could want to be
avenged, and he is obviously in no position to get satisfaction.
In other words, in order to end the reciprocal destruction in the
myth of Cadmus the warriors need only recognize Cadmus's role as

agent provocateur and become reconciled at his expense. It does not

matter whether the agent is real or not as long as everyone is convinced
of his reality and identity. How can anyone be sure that the victim is

really guilty since all that happened was a small stone falling, the noise
of a simple stone hitting other stones? A similar incident could happen
at any time without the person responsible intending any harm, in fact

without anyone being responsible at all W hat is important is the more
or less intense and universal faith ultimately inspired by the scapegoat

in his will and in his capability to sow disorder and therefore to reestab­
lish order. If the warriors had not discovered what had actually hap­

pened, or, if you prefer, if the scapegoat had not been so convincing,
they would not have stopped fighting and the crisis would have ended
in total annihilation.

The survivors represent the community that arises out of the myth
of Cadmus; the dead represent only disorder as apart from Cadmus him­
self. In the myth Cadmus represents both the power that created
disorder-he sowed the dragon's teeth-and the power that created
order-he saved humanity by destroying first the dragon and then the
multitude of warriors, draco redivivus, the new monster of a thousand
heads issued from the remains of the former monster. Cadmus therefore
is one of those gods who always provoke disorder but "only" in order to
put an end to it. Cadmus therefore is not a scapegoat explicitly in and
for this myth; he is implicitly a scapegoat, made sacred by the myth
itself, the god of the Thebans. This myth is merely ingenious; it does
not and cannot reveal finally the secret of its own creation but must rely
on the mechanism of the scapegoat.
Myths of the category "small causes, big results;' or if you like
"minor scapegoats, major crisis;' can be found all over the world and
often in such unique forms that it will not do to explain them away by
invoking "experiences?' The Indian version of the myth of Cadmus
might be traced to Indo-European influence, but it is impossible in the
South American version which is mentioned in Levi-Strauss's Mytho­

/ogiques. Invisible in a tree, an anthropomorphous parrot sows discord
beneath him by dropping things from his beak. It is difficult to argue
that all these myths have only their one purely logical and distinctive

88

T H E SCAPEGOAT

significance, and that they have absolutely nothing to do with human
violence.
COLLECTIVE MURDER has not been eliminated from all the texts of

ancient mythology. There are important exceptions among religious
commentators, great writers (especially those who wrote tragedies), and
historians as well. In reading the commentary we must remember my
analysis above. It would seem to me to shed new light both on the
rumors about Romulus and all similar rumors concerning certain
founders of cities and religions. Freud is the only major modern author
who took these rumors seriously. In his Moses and Monotheism he uses,
unfortunately too polemically, the "rumors" found on the periphery of
Jewish tradition, according to which Moses may have also been the
victim of collective murder. But he fails to draw the obvious conclusion
from the remarkable similarity of the rumors about Moses and those
about so many other religious lawgivers and founders (an unusual
omission for the author of Totem and Taboo, one that may be explained
by his overly partial critique ofthe Jewish religion). According to certain
sources Zarathustra was murdered by members, disguised as wolves, of
one of these ritual associations whose sacrificial violence he opposed, a
violence that had always had the collective and unanimous character of
the original murder which it reenacted. In the margins of official biogra·
phies there often lingers a more or less "esoteric" tradition of collective
murder.
Modern historians do not take these stories seriously. They can
hardly be criticized, not having the means to incorporate them into their
analyses. They choose to interpret them either within the framework of
a single author, in which case they must agree with what their sources
ironically or cautiously call unidentifiable gossip and "old wives' tales;'
or else within the framework of mythology or universal history. In this
case they are obliged to recognize that the theme, although far from
being universal, recurs too frequently to be ignored. Nor can collective
violence be called mythological since it categorically contradicts the
myths. Does this mean that our critics are forced finally to face the prob­
lem and acknowledge its existence? Not at all (there are endless ways to
avoid the truth). In their denial of the true meaning they resort to their
ultimate weapon, their deathblow: the disturbing theme is treated sim·
ply as rhetoric. Any insistence on the absence of collective violence or
continuing concern is purely decorative. We are naive if we allow our·

THE CRIMES O F THE GODS

89

selves to be convinced. None of the lifeboats is so unsinkable. After a
long disappearance the theme has resurfaced in our day, and the storms
of our apocalypse wash over it in vain. Even though it carries more pas­
sengers than the raft of the Medusa it will not sink; how can it be sunk?
No one in fact attaches any importance to collective murder. Let us
return to Livy, who is ofmore interest than the university that made him
hostage. This historian tells us how, in a great storm, Romulus "was
enveloped in such a thick cloud that he disappeared from the gaze of the
assembly. Since that time he has never again appeared on earth?' After
a moment of dumb dejection "the young Romans acclaim Romulus as
a new god?' But "I believe there were, from that time, skeptics who
maintained quietly that the king had been torn to pieces by the Fathers
with their bare hands: in fact, this is also said, in the great mystery; the
other version became popular because of the hero's prestige and dangers
of the time:14
Plutarch notes many versions of Romulus's death, three of them
forms ofcollective murder. According to one, Romulus was suffocated in
his bed by his enemies; according to another he was torn to pieces by the
senators in the Temple of Vulcan. In still another version the murder
took place in the Goat Marsh, during a great storm mentioned by Livy,
a storm that drove the crowds of people away while the senators closed
their ranks. As in Livy's version it is the senators, that is the murderers,
who establish the cult of the new god because they closed their ranks
against him:
Most of the populace accepted this story, and were happy to hear the news,
adoring Romulus in their beans in good faith, as they went about their busi·
ness; but there were some who set about harshly and bitterly to find out the
truth, and they disturbed the patricians greatly, letting it be known that they
were abusing the simple people with their empty and foolish arguments and
that it had been they who had killed the king with their own hands. 5

The legend, as such, is an antilegend. It is the result of an explicit
effort to demystify, reminiscent of Freud. The official version had to
become legend in order to consolidate the authority of the rulers. Romu­
lus's death resembles that of Pentheus in the Bacchae: "And yet some
thought that the senators had all rushed on him . . . and that after tearing

Clough (New York: Modern Library, 1 864), p. 44.

him to pieces, each had carried away a piece in the folds of his robe?'
This ending recalls the Dionysiac diasparagmos in which the victim is
torn to death by the mob. There are therefore unquestionably mytholog­
ical and religious echoes, but the diasparagmos happens spontaneously
among crowds gripped with a murderous frenzy. The account of the
great riots among the French people during the wars of religion teem
with examples similar to Plutarch's text. The rioters even fight over the
last remains of their victim, which they consider precious relics and
which could later be sold for the most exorbitant prices. There are end­
less examples which suggest a close relationship between collective vio­
lence and a process in which a victim becomes sacred without
necessarily already being powerful and renowned. The metamorphosis
of remains into relics has also been documented in the case of racial
lynchings in modern times.
The point of the "rumors" about Romulus is that the murderers
themselves transform their victim into a sacred object. The account has
a particularly modern ring to it, for they see in this affair a kind of politi­
cal plot, a story put together from many elements by people who never
lost their heads and knew exactly what they were doing. The text reflects
the perspective of the populace. In their struggle against the aristocracy,
the people reduce Romulus's becoming a god to a kind of plot against
the people, an instrument of propaganda for the senators. The idea that,
by making someone a god, the sordid reality of an event can be trans­
figured is very important. Nevertheless, no matter how seductive the ar­
gument of a deliberate cover-up may be to the modern mind, whose
tendencies it foreshadows, it cannot totally satisfy observers who are
aware of the essential role the phenomenon of mobs and their extreme
collective mimesis does play in the genesis of the sacred. By making the
mythological process a conscious fabrication at every stage, the rumors
mentioned by Livy and Plutarch will, if taken literally, lead us to make
the same mistakes as modern rationalists did about religion. Their true
relevance lies in the implied relationship between the birth of myth and
the unleashed mob. No nineteenth-century scholar ever went that far;
he would only retain what was untrue in the rumors: religion was
reduced to a plot of the powerful against the weak.
Every trace of collective violence must be examined, compared, and
criticized. In our analysis of the rumors we have revealed a dimension
that goes beyond the rough alternatives of traditional positivism, "true"

THE CRIMES OF THE GODS

91

and "false;' historical and mythological. The rumors cannot fit the
framework of these alternatives, so no one is capable of interpreting
them. For historians, they are even more suspect than all their own
accounts of the origins of Rome. Livy himself is aware of this. Nor can
the mythologists be interested in something that is presented as anti­
mythological rather than mythological. Rumors fall between the cracks
of organized knowledge, as always happens to the traces of collective
violence. As culture evolves, these traces are always expelled and elimi­
nated. Philology and modern criticism thus finish the work of the later
mythologies. Such is the process of so-called knowledge.
Collective violence continues to be concealed among us today by
the same insidious and irresistible process as in the past. For proof of
this we should turn once more to the body of myths concerning Romu­
lus and Remus. It will reveal that the process is in full operation among
us today and will help us understand that we ourselves are unconscious
intermediaries in concealing the traces as we interpret Livy's text.
Most of my readers are convinced, I suppose, that the heretical ver­
sions of the death of Romulus are the only representation of collective
murder in the whole of his myth. Everyone knows that there is an­
other violent death in the myth, which is always presented as a
murder but as an individual murder, namely, the death of Remus.
Romulus alone is the murderer. Ask any of your cultured friends and
they will all tell you that this is so. Romulus kills his brother in a
moment of anger because that brother mockingly leaped over the sym­
bolic boundaries of the city of Rome which Romulus had just finished
tracing.
This version ofthe murder is found in Livy, but it is neither the first
nor the only version. The first version contains collective murder. Com­
pared with the second, it is a classic example of a myth that has not yet
eliminated the representation of collective murder. The first version is
based on a quarrel over auguries. The flight of birds does not succeed in
deciding between Romulus and Remus, the enemy twins. This story is
well known; it has not been concealed, because it fits so easily with the
second version of the myth which always provides the ending. Unaware,
we all choose it because it is the version that eliminates collective murder.
Mter describing how the two brothers conceive of the idea of building
a new city on the very spot where "they were abandoned and reared;'
Livy adds:

92

THE SCAPEGOAT

To these subjects i s soon added the hereditary passion, the thirst to reign, and
this passion makes what was originally a peaceful enterprise into a criminal con·
fiict Since it is impossible to choose between the twins, even from the vantage
of age, it was up to the gods who protected the place to indicate by auguries the
one who would give his name to the new city, who would found it and rule it
First, Remus received an augury: six vultures. He had just announced it
when double the number appeared to Romulus. Each was proclaimed king by
his supporters. One claimed royalty by being first, the other because of the
number ofbirds. An argument ensues, which comes to blows; anger degenerates
into a murderous struggle. It is, then, in the scuffle that Remus falls dead.6

Everything is always equal between twins; there is conflict because
there is competition and rivalry. The conflict is caused not by difference
but by its absence. This is why structuralism, which interprets in terms
of binary opposites and differences, is no more capable of understanding
enemy twins than psychoanalysis "structured like a language?' Like
Greek tragedians who write of that other set of twins, Eteocles and Poly­
nices, Livy understands that the conflict of the twins cannot be resolved
because there is no difference between the antagonists. It indicates the
absence of separation as much as absolute separation: since it was impos­
sible to choose between the twins, even where age was concerned, it is left up
to the gods, but the gods themselves only appear to make a decision, a
decision which in itself was indecisive and only feeds the quarrel and
makes it fiercer. Each of the brothers desires what the other desires, even
when it is something that does not yet exist, the city of Rome. The
rivalry is purely mimetic and is identical with the sacrificial crisis,
which makes all the participants the same in the same conflicting desire,
and which transforms them all, not just the two brothers, into twins by
their own violence.
The translation I have quoted is not exactly inaccurate but it is
vague and unsatisfactory. It makes what is essential invisible. The collec­
tive character of the murder ofRemus, which is very precise in Livy's
Latin text, is almost unnoticeable in the translation. The Latin "in
turba;' that is "in the crowd;' becomes "in the scuffle?' Michel Serres
pointed out to me both the original Latin - ibi in turba ictus Remus
cecidit- and the remarkable process by which the translation I have
quoted is diminished and minimized. No doubt it will be pointed out
that the word scuffle in the present context suggests many participants,
6. Ibid., pp. 6- 7.

THE CRIMES OF THE GODS

93

which is true. But the word turba has an almost technical meaning; a
crowd that is confused, perturbed, and disturbing; it is the one word that
recurs most often in the numerous accounts of collective murders con­
tained in the first book of Livy. Its importance is such that its literal
equivalent is essential in any translation ofLivy's text. Its omission con­
tributes just as effectively, ifless spectacularly, to the elimination of col­
lective murder as texts such as the myth of Baldr or the myth of the
Curetes. At each different cultural period we can find the same
phenomenon, the concealment of the original murder. The process con­
tinues today through the most diverse ideologies, such as classical
humanism or the struggle against "Western ethnocentrism?'
No doubt people will think I am fantasizing. Proof that this is not
so can be found in the concept I have just discussed, that almost every­
one assumes that there is no representation of collective murder in a
myth like that of Romulus and Remus. It is in fact central to the myth
and disappears gradlially by a process of suffocation and strangulation,
the true intellectual equivalent of what the patricians did to Romulus
himself in one of the murders recorded in Plutarch. Michel Serres
shows that there are several other murders which hover ever in the back­
ground, being pushed further and further away until the moment that
has almost come to pass, when they disappear completely. At their first
mention "true scholars" raise their eyebrows; the second puts you be­
yond the pale of"serious" researchers, who now claim that the religious
phenomenon may not exist. You are considered a sort of intellectual ad­
venturer, greedy for sensation and publicity. At the very best you are
shamelessly exploiting collective murder, that sea serpent of mythologi­
cal studies.
I would like to reiterate that Livy's relevance does not lie in his con­
tribution of one more myth that portrays collective murder in his sub­
versive versions of the death ofRomulus. Even if it could be shown that
all myths originally contained this representation, the demonstration
would only be of secondary interest. The process that gradually
eliminates the collective murder is much more interesting because it is
too constant to be accidental.
Livy reveals methodically what can be called the elementary mytho­
logical drama: the (non)significance of twins, their mimetic rivalry, the
resulting sacrificial crisis that ends in collective murder. All of this can,
of course, be found in the great ancient writers and their classical imita­
. tors. By recognizing this common bond between Livy and Corneille, or

94

THE SCAPEGOAT

between Euripides and Racine, we acknowledge evidence of centuries­
long "censorship:' This is to be admired and imitated in Livy, and even
more so in the fact that he represented both the collective and the indi­
vidual version ofRemus's murder in the proper order of their diachronic
evolution. In contrast to contemporary schools of criticism, which still
adhere to a single synchronic order, the Roman historian perceives the
existence of a time of elaboration which always moves in the same direc­
tion, with the same objective, the elimination of collective murder. The
version without collective murder must be considered posterior to the
version in which it still appears, as I have tried to show in the myths of
Baldr and the Curetes. Mythological transformation moves in only one
direction, toward the �iimination of any trae�s of violenc��
It is worth noting that a truly apocalyptic tradition has always
existed in Rome. The violent destruction of the city was prophesied
from the time of its violent origin. In his History of Religious Ideas
Mircea Eliade speaks of the repercussions of the myth of Romulus and
Remus in the Roman conscience:
_

- - - ·-

The people will keep forever the terrifYing memory of that first bloody sacrifice
offered to the divinity of Rome. More than seven hundred years after the found­
ing ofRome Horace writes ofit in terms of an original sin which must inevitably
bring about the loss of the cicy by driving its sons to kill each other. At every
critical moment in its history, Rome agonizes over the weight of the curse it
bears. It was neither at peace with men at its birth, nor with the gods. This reli­
gious worry will weigh heavily on its destiny.7

This tradition is interesting because it makes the people as a whole
responsible for the original murder. It is rooted firmly in a collective ver­
sion of the murder and, even though there is a touch of magic in the con­
cept ofRome as the only city under this type of curse, nevertheless it ex­
presses in its own way a truth independent of its style of expression. The
foundation and structure of every community is based on violence that
is and should have remained destructive at its very essence, but by some
miracle the community has been able to ward off this violence which, for
the time being, has become constructive and has achieved a means of
reconciliation through some divinely bestowed reprieve.

CHAPTER EIGHT

The Science of Myths
WE KNOW NOW to recognize in religious forms, ideas, and institutions in
general the warped reflection of violent events that have been exception­
ally "successful" in their collective repercussions. We can identify the
commemoration in mythology of these same violent acts that are so suc­
cessful that they force their perpetrators to reenact them. This memory
inevitably develops as it is transmitted from generation to generation,
but instead of rediscovering the secret of its original distortion it lose�
it over and over again, each time burying it,a little deeper. As religion
and cultures are formed and perpetuated, the violence is hidden. The
discovery of their secret would provide what must be called a sa'entific
solution to man's greatest enigma, the nature and origins of religion.
,..
It is important not to confuse the reciprocal and ritualized extermi­
nation of "methodologies" with the totality of actual intelligence. This
drama is no more distracting than storms at sea; they roll over the sur­
face but leave the depths untouched. The more we become disturbed,
the more real our agitation appears while the invisible escapes us. The
pseudo-demystifiers can destroy each other without really weakening
the critical principle which is the source for them all but which becomes
less accurate. Recent doctrines have all evolved from one single process
ofdecoding, the oldest to be invented in the Western world and the only
truly lasting process. Precisely because it is uncontested, it goes unno­
ticed, like God himself. It has such a hold over us that it is confused
With immediate perception. If attention was drawn to the process in
action the observers would be astonished.
The reader has already recognized our old friend, the decoding of
representations of persecution. It seems banal in the context of our his-

96

THE SCAPEGOAT

tory, but remove it from that context and it is a n unknown quantity. Our
ignorance is not like that of M Jourdain, who speaks in prose without
knowing it. The local banality of the procedure in question should not
blind us to what is exceptional and even unique in an anthropological
framework. No one outside of our culture has ever discovered this
process; it can be found nowhere, and even for us there is something
mysterious in the way we use it without ever examining it.
We speak of the process negatively today and use it to accuse each
other of persecuting tendencies. It is contaminated by factions and
ideologies. In order to reveal it in its pure form I have chosen illustra­
tions from ancient texts that are free from interpretations subject to
modern controversies. The demystification of a Guillaume de Machaut
is universally acceptable. That was my starting point, and I shall always
return to it to cut short the endless fuss over our textualized mimetic
twins.
There is always an outcry, especially in such a troubled time as ours,
against powerful evidence, but such quibbling is not in the least impor­
tant intellectually. To go even further, it is possible that the revolt
against the type of evidence I have described may grow in strength and
we may once more be faced with the legions of Nuremberg or their
equivalent. The historical consequences would be catastrophic, but the
intellectual consequences would be nil. Cultural relativism and the
critics of "ethnocentrism" have overlooked this. W hether we like it or
not we must recognize it, and most of us do when forced to, but we do
not like the obligation. We have a vague fear that it will take us f urther
than we want.
Can we call this truth scientific? During the period when the term
science was unhesitatingly applied to all that we were most sure of, many
would have answered yes. Even today, many will say that only the scien­
tific mind could have brought an end to witch-hunts. The cause of those
witch-hunts was the belief in magic that was accompanied by persecu­
tion; the end of the witch-hunts had to be preceded by the end of belief
in magic. It is significant that the first scientific revolution in the West
coincides more or less with the definitive renunciation of witch-hunts.
In the language of the ethnologists we would say a determined orienta­
tion toward natural causes gradually displaced man's immemorial
preference for significant causes on the level of social relations which are
also the causes that are susceptible to corrective intervention, in other words
victims.

There is a close connection between science and the end of witch­
hunts. Is it enough to justify our qualifying the interpretation that sub­
verts the representation of persecution by revealing it as scientific? We
have become sensitive in recent years about matters of science.
Philosophers of science who are perhaps under the influence of the
times are less and less appreciative of stable certainties. They would
surely disapprove of an undertaking so free of risks and difficulties as the
demystification of a Guillaume de Machaut. Admittedly, it is incongru­
ous to invoke science in this case. So let's not use such an inflated term
for such an ordinary affair. I am agreeable on this point, especially since
in the light of it the necessarily scientific status of my undertaking be­
comes obvious. It is a question of interpreting texts by a process that no
one has ever considered using for that purpose, an ancient process of
decoding that has been very successful in its own domain of application
and has been proven to be valid on a thousand occasions.
The real argument over my hypothesis has not even begun. I have
limited myself to widening the angle of vision for a method of interpre­
tation the validity of which is unchallenged. The real question is
whether that enlargement is valid. Either I am right and I have really
discovered something or I am wrong and I have wasted my time. The
hypothesis that I have not invented but merely transposed only requires
minor adaptations if it is to be applied to myths just as it was applied to
Guillaume de Machaut. I could be right and I could be wrong, but I do
not have to be fundamentally right in order for the only adjective that
fits my hypothesis to be scientific.
The only reason for not applying the adjective scientific to the gener­
ally accepted reading of Guillaume de Machaut is not uncertainty but
rather excessive certainty, the absence of risk, the lack of an alternative.
As soon as our thesis of demystification is transposed to the domain of
myth, its characters change. Mundane evidence gives way to adventure;
the unknown reappears. There are numerous rival theories, and at least
for the moment they seem "more serious" than mine. The day will
come, however, when not to read the myth of Oedipus in the same way
as Guillaume de Machaut does will seem as strange as it does to compare
the two texts today. On that day the amazing disjunction we have
noticed between the interpretation of a myth in its mythological context
and of that same myth when it is transplanted to a historical context will
disappear.
Then the demythification ofmythology will no longer be a question

98

T H E S C A PE G O A T

of science just as it is no longer a question for Guillaume de Machaut
today.
Earlier we expressed a certain repugnance for describing as scien­
tific a hypothesis that was so free of risk and uncertainty. But a hypothe­
sis that consists only of risks and uncertainties is equally unscientific. To
earn the glorious title of scientific it must combine the maximum of ac­
tual uncertainty with the maximum of potential certainty. That is pre­
cisely the combination of my hypothesis. Researchers have decided too
rapidly, on the basis of past failures, that this combination is only possi­
ble in domains that are quantifiable and subject to experimental verifica­
tion. The fact that it is here, now, already realized, is proof to the
contrary. My hypothesis has existed for centuries and, thanks to it, the
transition from uncertainty to certainty in matters of demythification
has already occurred once; it could therefore occur a second time.
We are uneasy in the recognition that this is so because we are un­
willing to accept certainties; we tend to banish them to the obscure
corners of our mind; just as, a hundred years ago, we used to banish un­
certainties. We willingly forget that our demythification of sorcery and
other superstitions related to persecution constitutes a certainty that
cannot be shaken. If this certainty were tomorrow to encompass mythol­
ogy, we would certainly not know all, but we would have some hard and
probably definitive answers to some of the questions that research in­
evitably poses- or would pose had all hope of finding hard and defini­
tive answers not been lost.
My demystification of Guillaume de Machaut can certainly not be
considered "falsifiable" in the sense that Popper used the term. Does
that mean I must renounce it? Ifeven in this case certitude is not accept­
able, if we hold absolutely to the great democracy of a never-true-never­
false interpretation that is so popular these days for anything nonquan­
tifiable, then that is inevitably the result. We must condemn in retro­
spect all those who brought an end to the witch trials. They were even
more dogmatic than the witch-hunters and, like them, they believed
they possessed the truth. Should we disillusion them? What right have
these people to declare their interpretation to be the only right one when
thousands of other interpreters, eminent witch-hunters, distinguished
scholars, some of whom were even very progressive like Jean Bodin, had
a completely different idea ofthe problem? What insufferable arrogance,
what frightful intolerance, what shocking puritanism. Should we not let
all the different interpretations blossom, witches and nonwitches, natu-

ral and magical causes, those that are susceptible to corrective interven­
tion and those that never receive the correction they deserve.
By a slight change of context, without any real change of the essen­
tial, it is easy to see how ridiculous certain contemporary attitudes are,
or at least as regards their application to these matters. Critical thought
no doubt is in a state of extreme decadence, temporary it is to be hoped,
but the sickness is no less severe since it considers itself the supreme
refinement ofthe critical mind. If our ancestors had thought in the same
mode as do today's masters, they would never have put an end to the
witch trials. We should not be surprised, then, to see the recent most un·
deniable horrors doubted by people who are faced with an intelligentsia
reduced to impotency by sterile exaggerations to which it falls prey and
by the arguments that result from them. The self-destructive character
ofthese theses is no longer perceptible or, ifit is perceived, it seems only
like a "positive" development.

CHAPTER NINE

The Key Words of the
Gospel Passion
ThE PRECEDING ANALYSES force us to conclude that human culture is

predisposed to the permanent concealment of its origins in collective
violence. Such a definition of culture enables us to understand the suc­
cessive stages of an entire culture as well as the transition from one stage
to the next by means of a crisis similar to those we have traced in myths
and to those we have traced in history during periods of frequent perse­
cutions. During periods of crisis and widespread violence there is al­
ways the threat of subversive knowledge spreading, but that very
knowledge becomes one of the victims or quasi-victims of the convul­
sions of social disorder.
This model continues to be valid for our society; in fact it is even
more relevant, although it is clearly not enough to account for what we
call history, our history. Even if the process for decoding the persecu­
tors' accounts of persecution, which is central to our history, is not ex­
panded to include all of mythology, it nevertheless represents a major
defeat for cultural occultation that might rapidly become total. Either
culture is not as I have described it or the force of occultation sustaining
it must struggle against a counterforce in our universe that tends toward
the revelation of the immemorial lie.
We all know of the existence of this force of revelation, but instead
of recognizing it in my terms, most of us see it as the force of occultation.
This is the most serious misperception of our culture, and it will inevita­
bly be dissipated by our recognition of the full eff ect in mythology of the
illusions of persecution, an attenuated version of which we are now able
to decipher at the heart of our history.
The Christian Bible, the combination of the Old and New Testa-

T H E KEY WORDS O F THE GOSPEL PASSION

101

ments, has provided that force of revelation. The Bible enables us to de­
cipher what we have actually learned to identify in persecutors'
representations of persecution. It teaches us to decode the whole of
religion. The victory this time will be too decisive for the sustaining
force to remain hidden. The Gospels will be seen as that universal force
of revelation. For centuries the most respected scholars have declared
that the Gospels are merely one myth among many, and have succeeded
in convincing most people.
The Gospels do indeed center around the Passion of Christ, the
same drama that is found in all world mythologies. I have tried to show
that this is true of all myths. This drama is needed to give birth to new
myths, to present the perspective of the persecutors. But this same
drama is also needed to present the perspective of a victim dedicated to
the rejection of the illusions of the persecutors. Thus the same drama is
needed to give birth to the only text that can bring an end to all of
mythology.
In order to accomplish the prodigious feat, that of forever destroy­
ing the credibility of mythological representation (and this feat is being
accomplished right beneath our eyes), we must oppose the very real
force of myth, real because it has always had mankind in its grip, with
the even greater force of a true representation. The event portrayed must
indeed be the same or the Gospels would not be able to discredit point
by point all the characteristic illusions of mythologies that are also the
illusions of the protagonists of the Passion. 1
We are aware that the Gospels reject persecution. What we do not
realize is that, by doing so, they release its mechanism and demolish the
entire human religion and the resulting cultures: we fail to recognize the
fruit of the persecutors' accounts of persecution in the symbolic forces
surrounding us. But the very fact that these forms have a diminished
hold, and their power of illusion is weakened, is due precisely to our in­
creasing ability to identify the underlying scapegoat mechanisms. Once
understood, the mechanisms can no longer operate; we believe less and
less in the culpability of the victims they demand. Deprived of the food
that sustains them, the institutions derived from these mechanisms
collapse one after the other about us. Whether we know it or not,
the Gospels are responsible for this collapse. Let us therefore try and
prove it.

THE SCAPEGOAT

I n studying the Passion we are struck by the role played by quota­
tions from the Old Testament, particularly from the Psalms. The early
Christians took these references seriously, and the so-called allegorical
or figural interpretation in the Middle Ages involved the expansion and
appropriate amplification of this New Testament practice. Modern
critics generally, and mistakenly, have no interest in this. They tend
more to a rhetorical and strategic interpretation of the quotations. The
Evangelists make many innovations with respect to theology. We could
attribute to them the desire to make their innovations respectable by
sheltering them as much as possible behind the prestige of the Bible. In
order to gain acceptance for the extraordinary, endless exaltation of]esus
they place their writing under the protective shelter of texts that
denoted authority.
The Gospels, admittedly, highlight portions of the Psalms almost to
extreme, fragments seemingly of very little intrinsic interest and of such
platitude that their significance does not seem to justify their presence.
For example what should we conclude from John's (1 5:25) solemn refer­
ence in speaking of the condemnation of Jesus to the sentence: "They
hated me for no reason" (Ps. 35: 1 9)?2 And the Evangelist insists gravely
that the hostile forces are gathering for the Passion to fulfill the words
written in their Law. The awkwardness of the stereotyped formula rein­
forces our suspicion. There is unquestionably a link between the Psalm
and the way in which the Gospels report the death of]esus, but the sen­
tence is so banal, its application so obvious, that there is no need to em·
phasize it.
We have a similar impression when Luke has Jesus say: "These
words of Scripture have to be fulfilled in me 'He let himself be taken for
a criminal' " (Luke 22:37; Mark 1 5:28). This time the quotation is not
from the Psalms but from chapter 53 of lsaiah. The profound thought
that could inspire such references is not evident, and we fall back on the
ordinary ulterior motives of our own universe.
These two short sentences are actually extremely interesting in
themselves as well as in relation to the story of the Passion, but to under­
stand this, we must understand that the control exercised by persecutors
and their accounts of persecution over the whole of humanity are at
stake in the Passion. These sentences, which are apparently too trite to
2 Biblical quotations are taken from The Jerusalem Bible, Reader's Edition (New York:
Doubleday, 1968).

T H E K EY WORDS O F T H E GOSPEL PASSION

be taken seriously, express the denial of magic causality and stereotyped
accusations. It is refusal of everything that is accepted blindly by per­
secuting crowds, such as the Thebans' unhesitating acceptance of Oedi­
pus's responsibility for the plague, because he is incestuous; or the
Egyptians' imprisonment of the unfortunate Joseph, on the strength of
the gossip of a provincial Venus clinging to her prey. The Egyptians al­
ways behaved this way. We remain very Egyptian where mythology is
concerned, especially Freud, who charges Egypt with the truth ofJuda­
ism. All the theories in vogue are pagan in their attachment to parricide,
incest, etc., and in their blindness to the false character of stereotyped
accusations. We are very far behind the Gospels and even Genesis.
The Passion crowd also accepts blindly the vague accusations made
against Jesus. In their eyes Jesus becomes the cause that is susceptible
to corrective intervention, the Crucifixion. All those who love magical
thinking resort to it at the first sign of disorder in their world. Our two
quotations highlight the continuity between the Passion crowd and the
persecution crowds already stigmatized in the Psalms. Neither the
Gospels nor the Psalms accept the cruel illusions of these cruel crowds.
The two quotations stop short of any mythological interpretation. They
truly eradicate the root, for the victim's guilt is the mainspring of the
victim mechanism, and its apparent absence in the most developed of
the myths, those that manipulate or eliminate the scene of this murder,
has nothing in common with what is happening here. The uprooting in
the Gospels bears the same relationship to the mythological conjuring
tricks of a Baldr or the Curetes as the complete removal of a tumor to a
village quack's "magnetic" tricks.
Persecutors always believe in the excellence of their cause, but in
reality they hate without a cause. The absence of cause in the accusation
(ad causam) is never seen by the persecutors. It is this illusion that must
first be addressed if we are to release all the unfortunate from their in­
visible prison, from the dark underground in which they are stagnating
but which they regard as the most magnificent of palaces.
The Old Testament provides an inexhaustible source of legitimate
references to this extraordinary work of the Gospels, which is an account
of persecution that has been abrogated, broken, and revoked. We should
not wonder that the New Testament is dependent on the Old Testament
and relies on it Both are participating in the same enterprise. The in­
itiative comes from the Old Testament, but is brought to fruition by the
New Testament where it is accomplished decisively and definitively.

104

Particularly in the penitential Psalms we see the word shift from the
persecutors to the victims, from those who are making history to those
who are subjected to it. The victims not only raise their voices but are
also vociferous even in the midst of their persecution. Their enemies
surround them and prepare to strike them. Sometimes the latter retain
the monstrous, animal appearance they had in mythology; these are the
packs of dogs or herds of bulls, "strong beasts of Bashaan:' Yet these
texts are torn from mythology, as Raymond Schwager has clearly shown:
they increasingly reject sacred ambivalence in order to restore the victim
to his humanity and reveal the arbitrary nature of the violence that
strikes him. 3
The victim who speaks in the Psalms seems not in the least "moral;'
not evangelic enough for the good apostles of modern times. The sensi­
bilities of our humanists are shocked. Usually, the unfortunate victim
turns to hate those who hate him. The display of violence and resent·
ment "so characteristic of the Old Testament" is deplored, and is seen as
a particularly clear indication of the famous malice of the God oflsrael.
Ever since Nietzsche people have seen in the Psalms the invention of all
the bad feeling infecting us, humiliation, and resentment. We are
offered in contrast to the venomous Psalms the beautiful serenity of
mythologies, particularly Greek and German. Strong in their righteous­
ness, and convinced that their victim is truly guilty, persecutors have no
reason to be troubled.
The victim ofthe Psalms is disturbing, it is true, and even annoying
compared with an Oedipus who has the good taste to join in the wonder­
ful classical harmony. See with what art and delicacy, at the given mo­
ment, he denounces himself. He brings to it the enthusiasm of the
psychoanalytic patient on his couch or the old Bolshevist in the time of
Stalin. Make no mistake, he provides a model for the supreme confor­
mism of our time which is no different from the blustering of avant·
gardism. Our intellectuals are so eager for servitude that they formed
their Stalinist cells before Stalinism was invented. How can we be sur­
prised that they have waited fifty years or more before making discreet
inquiries into the greatest persecutions in human history. Mythology is
the very best school in the training of silence. We never hesitate between

the Bible and mythology. We are classicists first, romantics second, and
primitives when necessary, modernists with a fury, neoprimitives when
we are disgusted with modernism, gnostics always, but biblical never.
The causality of magic is one with mythology, so the importance of
its denial cannot be exaggerated. The Gospels are certainly aware of this
since the denial is repeated at every possible opportunity. They even put
it in the mouth of Pilate, who says, after interrogating Jesus, "I find no
case against this man?' ("Je ne vois pas de cause?'] Pilate has not yet been
influenced by the crowd, and the judge in him, the incarnation of
Roman law, oflegal rationality, acknowledges the facts in a brief but sig­
nificant moment.
But what is so extraordinary about the biblical rehabilitation of vic­
tims? Isn't it a common practice that dates right back to antiquity? Yes,
but previously the victims were rehabilitated by one group in opposition
to another. The faithful remain gathered around the rehabilitated victim
and the flame of resistance is never extinguished. Truth is not allowed
to submerge. That is what is false, with the result that the persecutors'
accounts of persecution are never really compromised or threatened in
mythology. Take the death of Socrates, for example. ''True" philosophy
never enters into it. It escapes the contagion of the scapegoat. There is
always truth in the world; even though this is no longer so at the mo­
ment of Christ's death. Even his favorite disciples are speechless in the
face of the crowd. They are literally absorbed by it. It is the Gospel of
Peter that informs us that Peter, the leader of the apostles, denied his
master in public. This betrayal is not anecdotal; it has nothing to do
with the psychology of Peter. The fact that even the disciples cannot re­
sist the effect of the scapegoat reveals the power exerted by the persecu­
tors' account over man. To understand what is happening we must
count the group of disciples among the forces that are united in con­
demning Christ, despite their usual disagreement. They are all forces
capable of endowing the condemned person's death with significance. It
is easy to enumerate them as they are always the same. They can all be
found in the witch-hunts or in the great totalitarian regressions of the
present day. First there are the religious leaders, then the politicians,
and above all the crowd. They all participate in the action - at first
separately, but gradually more and more in unison. Note that all these
forces intervene in the order of their importance, beginning with the
weakest and ending with the strongest. The conspiracy of religious
leaders is of symbolic but little real importance. Herod plays an even

106

T H E SCAPEGOAT

smaller role. The only reason for Luke's inclusion of Herod i n his ac­
count of the Passion is his fear of omitting any possible force that con­
tributed to the sentencing of Jesus.
Pilate is the person with real power, but ahead of him is the crowd.
Once mobilized, the crowd has absolute power, dragging institutions
with it until they are forced to disintegrate. Clearly, this is an example
of the unanimity of the generative collective murder of mythology. This
crowd is the group in dissolution, the community is literally dispersed
and cannot reform except at the expense of the victim, of the scapegoat.
Everything is therefore at its most favorable for the persecutors' con­
fident account of persecution. Yet this is not what is provided by the
Gospels.
The Gospels attribute to Pilate the desire to resist the verdict of the
crowd. Is this meant to make him more sympathetic and the Jewish
authorities more antipathetic by contrast? This is what is claimed, and
there are many who would explain everything in the New Testament in
the most ignoble light. These are truly today's crowd, possibly the
crowd of every day. Nevertheless they are wrong. Pilate in the end joins
the mob of persecutors. There is no need to study the psychology of Pi­
late. Instead the total power of the crowd should be underscored to show
that sovereign authority is forced to yield despite its impulse to resist. Pi­
late, however, has no real interest in the affair. Jesus is unimportant in
his eyes. He is so insignificant a person that even if Pilate had few politi­
cal instincts, he would not risk an uprising just to save him. Pilate's de­
cision is too easy, actually, to illustrate clearly the subordination of the
ruler to the crowd and the dominant role of the crowd at the moment of
greatest excitement when the mechanism of the scapegoat is set in
motion.
It seems to me that John introduces the character of the wife in or­
der to make Pilate's decision less easy and more revealing. Warned by a
dream, and more or less committed to the cause of Jesus, Pilate's wife
urges her husband to resist the crowd. John wants to show Pilate torn be­
tween two influences, between two poles of mimetic attraction, on the
one hand the wife who wants to save an innocent man and, on the other,
the totally anonymous and impersonal crowd that is not even Roman.
No one would be closer to Pilate than his wife, no one more closely
linked to his existence. No one could exercise more influence on him
than this wife who knows how to play on his religious fear. Yet the crowd
wins out; nothing is more important than this victory, nothing more sig-

T H E KEY WORDS O F T H E G O S P E L P ASSION

107

nificant for the revelation of the mechanism that selects a victim. We
shall see later that the Gospels present another victory similar to that of
the crowd in yet another scene of collective murder, the beheading of
John the Baptist.
We would be seriously mistaken if we thought that this crowd was
composed only of representatives of the lower classes; it does not repre­
sent only the "popular masses'!.. the elite also form a part, and the
Gospels cannot be accused of social condescension. To understand this
crowd we should once more turn to quotations from the Old Testament,
where we shall find the clearest commentary on the purpose of the
Gospels.
In chapter 4 of the Acts of the Apostles, a book that is evangelical
in character, Peter gathers his companions together in order to meditate
on the Crucifixion. He quotes to them at length the Psalm that describes
the pervasively hostile reception that the forces of the world reserve for
the Messiah:
Why this arrogance among the nations,
these futile plots among the peoples?
Kings on eanh setting out to war,
princes making an alliance,
against the Lord and against his Anointed.
This is what has come true: in this very city Herod and Pontius Pilate made an
alliance with the pagan nations and the peoples of Israel, against your holy
servant Jesus whom you anointed, but only to bring about the very thing that
you in your strength and your wisdom had predetermined should happen.
(Acts 4:25-28)

Here, too, the modern reader questions the interest ofthe quotation.
He does not understand and suspects some petty ulterior motive. Isn't
it simply an effort to endow Jesus' ignoble death with nobility and pro­
vide a grandiose orchestration for the somewhat insignificant agony of
an unimportant preacher from Galilee? A moment ago we were accusing
the Gospels of scorn for the mob of persecutors, and now we suspect
them of exalting the same crowd to increase their hero's prestige. Which
is to be believed? This type of speculation is wrongheaded. Systematic
suspicion in the face of the Gospels never yields interesting results. In­
stead we should return to the question that has guided our entire study.
What in this text can be traced to a representation of persecution from
the standpoint of persecutors and to its root in unanimous violence? All

108

T H E SCAPEGOAT

o fthis is categorically subverted at the very point ofits greatest strength:
the unanimity of the forces capable of providing the basis for such an ac­
count. Not only is there actual subversion but also a conscious desire to
subvert the whole mythology of persecution and make the reader aware.
With this recognition the relevance of the Psalms is immediately
apparent.
The Psalm provides the list of all these forces. The conjunction, on
the one hand, of the people's restlessness, the rumbling of nations, with
kings and leaders, the constituted authorities, on the other, is essential.
This conjunction is irresistible everywhere else but in the Passion of
Christ. The fact that this formidable coalition is formed at a relatively
low echelon and in a remote province of the Roman empire does not in
any way reduce the importance of the Passion which consists in the fail­
ure of persecutors' representation of persecution and the exemplary
force of that failure.
The coalition remains invincible on the level of brute force, but it
is no less "vain" in the words of the Psalm because it is unsuccessful in
imposing its viewpoint. It has no difficulty in putting Jesus to death but
it does not prevail on the level of significance. The weakness of Holy
Friday gives way in the disciples to the strength of Pentecost, and the
memory of Jesus' death will be important in a far different way from
what the rulers wanted. Its importance will not be immediately appar­
ent in all its incredible newness, but it will gradually pervade all the
converted, teaching them how to recognize the persecutors' accounts of
persecution and reject them.
By putting Jesus to death the rulers fall into a trap since it is their
own earlier secret, revealed in my quotations from the Old Testament
and in many other passages, that is fully inscribed in the account of the
Passion. The scapegoat mechanism becomes brilliantly apparent; it is
advertised widely, and becomes the most talked-about and well-known
news. Men will learn slowly, very slowly (for they are not very intelli­
gent) to insert this knowledge into accounts of persecution.
Men will finally be liberated by means of this knowledge, which
will help them first to demystify the quasi-mythologies of our own his­
tory and then, before long, to demolish all the myths of our universe
whose falsehoods we defend not because we believe in them but because
they protect us from the biblical revelation that will spring from the
ashes of mythology and with which it has long been confused. The vain
undertakings of people are even more the order of the day, but it is

T H E KEY W ORDS O F T H E GOSPEL PASSION

109

child's play for the Messiah to thwart them. The stronger the illusion
the more ridiculous they will seem to us tomorrow.
The essential factor, though it is never perceived by theology or hu­
man sciences, is that the persecutors' perception of their persecution is
finally defeated. In order to achieve the greatest effect that defeat must
take place under the most difficult circumstances, in a situation that is
the least conducive to truth and the most likely to produce a new
mythology. This is why the Gospel text constantly insists on the irra­
tionality ("without a cause") of the sentence passed against the just and
at the same time on the absolute unity of the persecutors, of all those
who believe or appear to believe in the existence and validity of the
cause, the ad causam, the accusation, and who try to impose that belief
on everyone.
It is a waste of time to examine, as certain modern commentators do,
the unequal way in \\lhich the blame in the Gospels is attributed to the
various protagonists of the Passion, since to do so indicates an essential
misunderstanding of the real purpose ofthe account. Like the Heavenly
Father, the Gospels have no favorites; their only interest is in the una­
nimity of the persecutors. All the schemes that are meant to reveal anti­
Semitism, elitism, antiprogressiveness, and any other such crime that
the Gospels could be accused of in the face of innocent humanity, its
victim, are only of interest because their symbolism is so transparent.
The authors of these schemes do not realize that they are interpreted by
the text that they think has settled their case conclusively. Among the
foolish undertakings of mankind, there is none more ridiculous than
this.
There are a thousand ways to avoid understanding the message of
the Gospels. When psychoanalysts and psychiatrists turn their atten­
tion to the Passion they readily discover in the unanimous circle of
persecutors a reflection of the "characteristic paranoia of the early Chris­
tians;' the traces of a "persecution complex?' They are sure of this be­
cause it is based on the strongest authorities: Marxists, Nietzscheans,
and Freudians for once all agree on this one point- that the Gospels are
at fault. Yet this same type of interpretation never occurs to these same
psychoanalysts when confronted with the witch-hunts. In this case it is
not the victims they attack but their persecutors. The change of target
is a relief. A mere glimpse of the reality of the persecution suffices to un­
derstand that the psychoanalytic theses are hateful and ridiculous when
applied to real victims and real acts of collective violence. Persecution

1 10

T H E SCA PEGOAT

complexes certainly exist, and often most intensely in doctors' waiting
rooms, but persecution also exists. The unanimity of the persecutors
may only be a paranoic hallucination, especially in privileged modern
Western society, but it is also a real phenomenon that occurs from time
to time. Those who are obsessed with hallucination will never have the
least hesitation in applying their principles. They always know a priori
that outside ofhistory there is only hallucination; there is no real victim.
The same stereotyped persecutors can be found everywhere, but
they are not recognized. Once again it is the exterior casing, in this case
historical, in the other religious, that determines the choice of interpre­
tation, rather than the text under consideration. We find again that
invisible line that crosses through our culture; underneath we admit the
possibility of real acts of violence, above we are no longer willing to
admit it and we fill the void created with all the pseudo-Nietzschean
abstractions and their linguistic barriers. It becomes increasingly clear:
after German idealism all the ups and downs of contemporary theory
are no more than petty arguments meant to prevent the demystification
of mythologies, new mechanisms for retarding the progress of biblical
revelation.
WITHOUT USING OUR terminology, yet omitting none of the knowledge

necessary to protect us from its insidious effects" the Gospels reveal t!Ie
scapegoat mechanism everywhere, even within us. If I am right in this,
then we should be able to trace in the Gospels everything that we have
identified about the mechanism in the preceding pages, especially its
unconscious nature. The persecutors would not allow themselves to be
restricted to their accounts of persecution were it not for this uncon­
sciousness which is identical with their sincere belief in the culpability
of their victim. It is a prison whose walls cannot be seen, a servitude the
more complete because it assumes freedom, a blindness that believes its
perceptiveness.
Does the idea of the unconscious belong to the Gospels? The word
does not appear, but modern readers will recognize it immediately if
their minds are not paralyzed when confronted with the text and bound
by the traditional Lilliputian threads of piety and antipiety. The sen­
tence that defines the unconscious persecutor lies at the very heart of the
Passion story in the Gospel of Luke: "Father, forgive them; they do not
know what they are doing (Luke 23:34). Christians insist here on the
_
goodness of Jesus. This would be fine were it not that their insistence

T H E KEY WORDS OF THE GOSPEL PASSION

lll

eclipses the sentence's real meaning, which is scarcely ever recognized.
The commentary on this sentence implies that the desire to forgive
unpardonable executors forces Jesus to invent a somewhat trifling excuse
for them that hardly conforms to the reality of the Passion.
Commentators who refuse to believe what this sentence says can
only feel faint admiration for it, and their devotion imbues the text with
the taint of their own hypocrisy. The most terrible distortion of the
Gospels is our ability to project our own hypocrisy on them. In reality
the Gospels never seek lame excuses; they never speak for the sake of
speaking; sentimental verbiage has no place in them.
If we are to restore to this sentence its true savor we must recognize
its almost technical role in the revelation of the scapegoat mechanism.
It says something precise about the men gathered together by their
scapegoat. They do not know what they are doing. That is why they must
be pardoned. This is not dictated by a persecution complex or by the
desire to remove from our sight the horror of real violence. In this pas­
sage we are given the first definition of the unconscious in human his­
tory, that from which all the others originate and develop-in ·;�aker
form: the Freudians will push the dimension of persecution into the
background and the Jungians will eliminate it altogether.
The Acts of the Apostles put the same idea into the mouth of Peter
when he is addressing the crowds in Jerusalem, the same people that
witnessed the Passion: "Now I know, brothers, that neither you nor
your leaders had any idea what you were really doing?' The considerable
interest of this sentence lies in the fact that it once more draws our atten­
tion to the two categories of forces, the crowd and the leaders, both of
whom are equally unconscious. It is an implicit rejection of the falsely
Christian idea that made the Passion a unique event because of its evil

dimension since its uniqueness lies in its dimension of revelation. lfwe
accept the first idea we are making a fetish of violence and reverting to
a variation of mythological paganism.

CHAPTER TEN

That Only One Man
Should Die
ONLY THE AcruAL formulation of the process by which a victim pays for

others in some way is still missing. The most explicit sentence in this
regard in the Gospels is the one that John puts in the mouth ofthe High
Priest Caiaphas during the debate that ends in the decision to put Jesus
to death. It articulates unequivocally everything that I have mentioned:
Then the chief priests and Pharisees called a meeting. "Here is this man work­
ing all these signs;' they said, "and what action are we taking? If we let him go
on in this way everybody will believe in him, and the Romans will come and
destroy the Holy Place and our nation:' One of them, Caiaphas, the high priest
that year, said, ''You don't seem to have grasped the situation at all; you fail to
see that it is better for one man to die for the people, than for the whole nation
to be destroyed:' He did not speak in his own person, it was as high priest that
he made this prophecy that Jesus was to die for the nation - and not for the
nation only, but to gather together in unity the scattered children of God From
that day they were determined to kill him. (John 1 1 :47-53)

The reason for the council is the crisis caused by Jesus' excessive
popularity. But this is but the temporary form of a greater crisis in the
entire Jewish society which ends, less than half a century later, in the
complete destruction of the state of Israel. The existence of a debate
already indicates that a decision is impossible. The indecisive debate
reflects the crisis that it endeavors to decide. Because it gets nowhere
Caiaphas interrupts somewhat impatiently and abruptly: "Ye know
nothing at all;' he says. Listening to Caiaphas, all the leaders say: "But
this is true; it is better for one man to perish and for the nation to sur­
vive. How come I didn't think of that?" No doubt they had thought of

T HAT ONLY O N E MAN S H OULD DIE

113

it, but only the boldest o f the leaders, the most convinced and decisive,
could express the thought explicitly.
Caiaphas is stating the same political reason we have given for the
scapegoat: to limit violence as much as possible but to turn to it, if
necessary, as a last resort to avoid an even greater violence. Caiaphas is
the incarnation of politics at its best, not its worst. No one has ever been
a better politician.
There are nevertheless all sorts of risks attached to violence; by tak­
ing them on Caiaphas proves himself a leader. The others rely on him.
They adopt him as their model; they imitate his serene certainty. Listen­
ing to Caiaphas, they no longer doubt. If the entire nation is sure to
perish then it obviously would be better for one man to die for all the
others, especially since he increases the imminence of the danger by
refusing to keep quiet.
Caiaphas's statement triggers to a certain extent the effect of the
scapegoat it defines. It not only reassures his listeners, it galvanizes them
into action; it "mobilizes" them in the sense that we speak of mobilizing
the military, or the "militants" who must be mobilized. What is at work?
The formation of the famous group in fusion that Jean-Paul Sartre
dreamed of, without of course ever saying that it will produce nothing
but victims.
For the statement to have such an effect it has to be understood in
a superficial and mythic way. The political reason defined above
remains mythic because it is based on what is still hidden in the political
interpretation within the "victimage" mechanism, the same thing that
controls the council ofCaiaphas as it controls our world. The scapegoat
effect is clearly very weakened just as it is weakened in modern history.
That is why the political reason is always contested by its victims and
denounced as persecution even by those who would unwittingly resort to
it should they find themselves in a position similar to Caiaphas's. The
political reason is offered because the mechanism is worn out and its
transcendent qualities are replaced by the justification of social utility.
The political myth permits the appearance of enough of the truthful
aspects of the process to give many people today the illusion that the
generalized political reading contains the sort of complete revelation of
"victimage" mechanisms and their justification that has sometimes been
attributed to me.
For the sentence to be truly revealing it must be understood not in
the political sense but in the evangelic sense, in the context of every-

1 14

THE SCAPEGOAT

thing I have identified and everything that can be identified. Then we
can recognize the brilliant definition of the mechanism revealed in the
Passion story, in all the Gospels, and in the entire Bible. The scapegoat
that takes shape under our eyes is the same as at the origin of Judaic
sacrifices. Caiaphas is the perfect sacrificer who puts victims to death to
save those who live. By reminding us of this John emphasizes that every
real cultural decision has a sacrificial character (deddere, remember, is to
cut the victim's throat) that refers back to an unrevealed effect of the
scapegoat, the sacred type of representation of persecution.
The High Priest's decision provides the definitive revelation of
sacrifice and its origin. It is expressed without either the speaker or the
listeners being aware. Not only do Caiaphas and his listeners not know
what they are doing, they do not know what they are saying. They must
therefore be forgiven. It is all the more necessary because our political
realities are usually more sordid than theirs; only our language is more
hypocritical. We avoid speaking like Caiaphas because we have a clearer,
though still imperfect, understanding ofthe meaning ofhis words. This
is proof that revelation is making its way among us. But we would have
no idea of this from reading either New Testament studies, religious his­
tory, ethnology, or political science. The experts see none of what we
have been discussing. Everyone shares this knowledge except for them;
the disciplines I have mentioned will have nothing to do with it Every­
thing seems to be done to neutralize and contain true intuition rather
than cultivate it. This is always the case at the beginning of great revolu­
tions. Resistance to knowledge of the scapegoat mechanism will prevent
the upheaval. It is merely one more sign of its proximity.
Ifwe are truly to understand the sentence in John and gain the most
benefit from its revelation within the evangelic context, we must not
isolate it from that context. Understanding no longer depends on merely
justifying the mechanism; it is meant to increase our resistance to the
temptation of the victimization, to the representations of persecution
that surround it, and to the mimetic consequences that favor it. It is the
inverse of the effect on those who heard it first Both effects can be ob­
served today which is one of the signs that our history, for better or for
worse, is inseparable from the revelation of the Gospels.
FROM THE anthropological perspective the essential characteristic of the

revelation is the crisis it provokes in every representation of persecution
from the standpoint of the persecutor. There is nothing unique about

THAT ONLY ONE MAN S HOULD DIE

115

the persecution i n the story of the Passion. The coalition o f all the
worldly powers is not unique. This same coalition is found at the origin
of all myths. What is astonishing about the Gospels is that the unanimity
is not emphasized in order to bow before, or submit to, its verdict as in
all the mythological, political, and even philosophical texts, but to
denounce its total mistake, its perfect example of nontruth.
This is what constitutes the unparalleled radicalism of the revela­
tion. To understand it we must briefly evoke, in contrast, the political
thought of the modern Western world. The forces of this world are
clearly divided into two nonsymmetrical groups, on the one hand the
constituted authorities and, on the other, the crowd. The former usually
get the better of the latter, but in times of crisis the reverse is true. Not
only does the crowd get the upper hand but it also becomes a kind of
melting pot in which even authorities that seem unshakable eventually
collapse. This process of fusion assures the reformation of the authori­
ties through the mediation of the scapegoat, or in other words the
sacred. The theory of mimesis throws light on a process that political
science and the natural sciences have been unable to penetrate.
The crowd is so powerful that the most surprising results can be
achieved without even assembling the entire community. The con­
stituted authorities give in to them and yield up the victims demanded
by their caprice, just as Pilate gives up Jesus or Herod John the Baptist.
Thus the authorities swell the crowd with their number and are
absorbed by them. In understanding the Passion we come to understand
the temporary removal of any difference not only between Caiaphas and
Pilate, or Judas and Peter, but between those who cry out or allow others
to cry out: "Crucify him!"
No matter whether "conservative" or "revolutionary," modern polit­
ical thought criticizes only one category of powers, either the crowd or
the established rulers. For them, it is a necessity to give systematic sup­
port to the other. It is this choice that classifies them either "conserva­
tive" or "revolutionary:' The continuing fascination of the Social

Contract is owing not to the truths it may contain but to the dizzying
oscillation it maintains between these two forces. Instead of resolutely
choosing one and holding to that choice, like the rational members of all
parties, Rousseau wanted to reconcile the irreconcilable; his work is
somewhat like the disturbance of a real revolution, incompatible with
the great principles it expresses.
Those who are conservative try to consolidate the constituted

116

T H E SCAPE GOAT

authorities, the institutions that embody the continuation o fa religious,
cultural, political, and judicial tradition. They are susceptible to criti­
cism for their excessive bias toward the established powers. They are
equally susceptible to threats of violence from the crowd. For the
revolutionaries the reverse is true. They systematically criticize institu­
tions and shamelessly revere the violence of the crowd. The revolution­
ary historians of the French and Russian revolutions mythologize all the
crimes. Any serious research into the crowd is considered reactionary by
them. They do not welcome illumination in these areas. It is a fact that
"victimage" mechanisms need obscurity if they are to "change the
world:' Nonetheless the great revolutionary writers provide explicit
confirmation of the symbolic role of real violence, Saint-Just on the
death of the king for example.
For the very reason that revolutionaries resort openly to violence,
the desired effects are no longer produced. The mystery has been
exposed. The foundation of violence was not effective and could only be
maintained by terror. Some of this is true ofthe French Revolution com­
pared with Anglo-American democracy; it is even more valid for the
Marxist revolutions. Modern political thought cannot dispense with
morals, but it cannot become purely moral without ceasing to be politi­
cal. Another ingredient must therefore be mixed with morals. If we
really tried to identify what this is we would inevitably end up with
formulas like Caiaphas's: "It is better that this man or those die so that
the community may survive?'
Different schools of political thought no less than competing
schools of criticism are based on partial and biased adaptations of the
Gospel revelation. Our world is full of Christian heresies, i.e., divisions
and portions. If the revelation is to be used as a weapon of divisive
power in mimetic rivalry it must first be divided. As long as it remains
intact it will be a force for peace, and only if it is fragmented can it be
used in the service of war. Broken into pieces it provides the opposing
doubles with weapons that are vastly superior to what would be availa­
ble in its absence. This is the reason for the endless dispute over the
remains of the body of the text, and why today the revelation itself is
held responsible for the evil usage that has been made of it. The
apocalyptic chapter of Matthew sums up the whole process in one star­
tling sentence: "Wherever the corpse is, there will the vultures gather"
(Matt. 24:28).

T H A T ONLY ONE MAN SHOULD DIE

117

The Gospels constantly reveal what the texts o f historical persecu­
tors, and especially mythological persecutors, hide from us: the knowl­
edge that their victim is a scapegoat, in the sense that we describe
Guillaume de Machaut's Jews as scapegoats. The expression scapegoat
is not actually used, but the Gospels have a perfect substitute in the lamb
of God. Like "scapegoat;' i t implies the substitution of one victim for all
the others but replaces all the distasteful and loathsome connotations of
the goat with the positive associations of the lamb. It indicates more
clearly the innocence of this victim, the injustice of the condemnation,
and the causelessness of the hatred of which it is the object.
Thus everything is completely explicit. Jesus is constantly com­
pared with and compares himself with all the scapegoats of the Old
Testament, all the prophets that were assassinated or persecuted by their
communities: Abel, Joseph, Moses, the Servant of Yaweh, and so on.
Whether he is chosen by others or self-appointed, his role as a despised
victim, inasmuch as he is innocent inspires the designation. He is the
stone rejected by the builders that will become the cornerstone. He
is also the millstone of scandal that will bring down even the wisest
because of his ambiguous role which is easily confused with the old­
style gods . Everything down to the title of king contains a reference to
the "victimary" character of sacred royalty. Those who demand an
unequivocal sign should be content with the sign of Jonah.
What is the sign ofJonah? The reference to the whale, in Matthew's
text, is not very revealing; Luke's silence and that of all the exegetes is
preferable. But nothing prevents us from trying to provide a better
answer than Matthew to the question that was probably left unanswered
by Jesus himself. In the very first lines we are given the information.
During a storm Jonah is chosen by lot to be the victim thrown overboard
by the sailors to save their ship in distress. The sign of Jonah is yet
another sign of the collective victim.
WE THEREFORE HAVE two types oftext that are related to the "scapegoat:'

Although they all concern victims, one group- mythological texts and
those of Guillaume de Machaut, for example - does not mention that
the victim is a scapegoat and forces us to articulate that fact instead. The
other group - the Gospels - tells us explicitly that the victim is a scape­
goat. I am not being particularly perceptive in calling Jesus a scapegoat
since the text already makes that point as explicitly as possible by calling

1 18

T H E SCAPEGOAT

him the Lamb o f God, the stone rejected by the builders, the one who
suffers for everyone, and, especially, in presenting the distortion of
persecution as distortion, tluu which must not be believed, in other words.
I am interpreting Guillaume de Machaut, however. When I exclaim
at the end of his text: "The Jews are scapegoats;• I am stating something
that does not appear in the text and that contradicts the sense intended
by the author. The latter is not presenting a distortion from his persecu­
tor's viewpoint but what he believes to be the bare truth. The scapegoat
released to us by the text is a scapegoat both in and for the text. The
scapegoat that we must disengage from the text for ourselves is the
scapegoat of the text. He cannot appear in the text though he controls
all its themes; he is never mentioned as such. He cannot become the
theme of that text that he shapes. This is not a theme but a mechanism
for giving structure.
I have promised to be as simple as possible, and the contrast be­
tween theme and structure may seem abstract and to some readers may
smack of jargon. It is, however, indispensable. If it is to become clear it
must be applied to the problem confronting us. The comment on
Guillaume's text ''The Jews are scapegoats" summarizes the correct

interpretation of this text. In the place of the author's uncritical presenta­
tion of persecution we substitute an interpretation that puts the Jews in
the same place as Jesus in the story of the Passion. They are not cul­
pable; they are victims of a hatred without cause. The entire crowd and
in some cases the authorities are in agreement to the contrary, but this
unanimity does not impress us. The persecutors know not what they are
doing.
When we engage in this type of decoding, we are all involved, with­
out knowing it, in structuralism at its best. Structural criticism is older
than we think, and I shall locate its origin as far back as possible in order
to use undeniable and unquestioned examples. It is enough to identify
the scapegoat in the case of Guillaume de Machaut because here the
term articulates the hidden structural principle that is the source of all
themes. It provides $e basis for the stereotypes of persecution presented
from the false perspective of an author who is incapable of recognizing
in the Jews described by him the scapegoats that we identify, in the same
way as the Gospels identify Jesus as a scapegoat.
It would be absurd to assimilate the two types of texts, Guillaume
de Machaut and the Gospels, under the pretext that they are both deal­
ing with a certain connection with the "scapegoat?' They describe the

THAT ONLY ONE MAN SHOULD D I E

119

same event i n such different ways that i t would b e stupid to confuse
them. The fi rst tells us that the victim is guilty. Because it reflects the
scapegoat mechanism that binds it to an uncritical representation of
persecution, we ourselves are engaged in the criticism. The second pre­
cedes us in that same criticism since it proclaims the innocence of the
victim.
It is important to understand why this potential confusion is stupid
and wrong. We would be equally wrong if we did not distinguish, for ex­
ample, between the anti-Semitism of Guillaume and the denunciation
of this same Guillaume by a modern historian, on the pretext that the
two texts, that of Guillaume and that of the historian, both have a close
yet ill-defined relationship with the scapegoat mechanism. Such a confu­
sion would really be the height of the grotesque and of intellectual
perversity.
Before invoking the scapegoat in connection with a text we must
first ask whether we are dealing with a scapegoat of the text (the hidden
structural principle) or a scapegoat

in the text (the clearly visible

theme). Only in the first case can the text be defined as one of persecu­
tion, entirely subjected to the representation of persecution from the
standpoint of the persecutor. This text is controlled by the effect of a
scapegoat it does not acknowledge. In the second case, on the contrary,
the text acknowledges the scapegoat effect which does not control it.
Not only is this text no longer a persecution text, but it even reveals the
truth of the persecution.
It is absurd to pretend that Guillaume de Machaut's text has
nothing to do with the scapegoat structure because it does not mention
it. A text in which there is little mention of the scapegoat effect is more
likely to be dominated by it, since it is less capable of identifying its con­
trolling principle. In this case, and only in this case, the text is written
entirely as a function of the illusion of a victim and his false culpability,
the magic causality. We are not so foolish as to expect the explicit men­
tion of the scapegoat or his equivalent in texts written from the perspec­
tive of the persecutor. If the decoding of representations of persecution
by the persecutors must wait for the perpetrators of violence to be so
good as to acknowledge their role in destroying scapegoats, then we can
expect a long wait I am happy enough that they leave indirect but fairly
transparent signs of their persecutions, fairly transparent, ofcourse, but
requiring interpretation. Why would myths be any different? Why
would the same stereotypes of persecution or their visible concealment

120

T H E SCAPEGOAT

not constitute also the indirect signs of the structure of persecution, of
the scapegoat effect.
We reserve the structural usage of scapegoat for the world around
us, going back as far as the Middle Ages. As soon as we move from
historical to mythological and religious texts, we literally forget this
usage, no matter how banal, and substitute a kind of ritual scapegoat not
in the biblical sense, which might lead somewhere, but in the sense of
Frazer and his disciples, who bury us in an uninteresting impasse. Rites
are indeed mysterious actions, particularly for those who practice them,
but they are deliberate and intentional. Cultures cannot practice their
rites unconsciously. Rites are the themes and motifs at the heart of the
vast cultural text. By interpreting the expression scapegoat in the ritual
sense only and making a generalization of it, Frazer has done a grave
injustice to ethnology. He conceals the most interesting meaning of the
expression, which appeared at the beginning of the modern era and
which never indicated any kind of rite or theme, or cultural motif, but
rather identified the unconscious mechanism for the representation and
acts of persecution, the scapegoat mechanism.
By inventing scapegoat rites, because he, too, did not understand
the origin of all the rites in the mechanism of the scapegoat, Frazer has
annoyingly short-circuited the opposition between them and structure,
typical of the science ofhis time. He did not perceive that the popular
and common expression that comes to our lips in reading the text of
Guillaume de Machaut is infinitely more rich, interesting, and promis­
ing than all the themes and all the moufs contained in the encyclopedia
he was compiling which was purely thematic and inevitably tainted.
Frazer turned straight to Leviticus for a Hebrew rite to head the list of
a whole nonexistent category of ritual without ever questioning the con­
nection between religion in general and the type of phenomenon
alluded to when we say that an individual or a minority group acts as
"scapegoat" for the majority. He did not understand that there was
something essential in this phenomenon for the understanding of the
scapegoat; he did not see that it extended into our own time. He only
saw an ignorant superstition that religious disbelief and positivism have
served to remove. He perceived in Christianity the remains of and even
the ultimate triumph of that superstition.
As soon as we turn our thoughts today from the historical to the
mythological we still irresistibly slip from the structural scapegoat into
the pathetic commonplace of theme and motif invented by Frazer and

T HAT ONLY ONE MAN S HOULD DIE

121

his disciples. But if that group of intellectuals had not been there to do
the work, others would have taken their place. The work was three­
quarters done when they began it. We should not compound the origi­
nal error by imagining that this, too, is an easy error to correct. There
is something fundamental at stake. Judging from the persistence of mis­
understandings, the aversion to the structural usage of the scapegoat in
mythology and religion goes far beyond the field of ethnology. It is part
of the general cultural schizophrenia. We refuse to apply the same
criteria used in reading history to the interpretation of mythology and
religion.
It is significant that the Cambridge ethnologists looked everywhere
for the scapegoat rite which they felt should correspond to the myth of
Oedipus. They sensed that there was a close relationship between Oedi­
pus and the "scapegoat;' and they were right, but they could not under­
stand the nature of that relationship. The current positivism prevented
them from seeing anything but themes and motifs. The concept of a
structural principle that is absent from the text it structures would have
seemed epistemologically incomprehensible to them. It is the same for
most scholars, and I am not even sure that I can make myself under­
stood, despite my reference in the interpretation of Guillaume de
Machaut, accepted unhesitatingly by everyone, to a scapegoat that can­

not be found in the text.
Other knowledgeable readers since Frazer, among them Marie Del­
court and, more recently, Jean-Pierre Vernant, have again sensed that
myth has "something to do" with the scapegoat . One would have to be
very blind and deaf indeed not to perceive the stereotypes of persecution
that are so conspicuous and make myth the most glaring example of all
witchcraft trials. But no one will ever resolve this poor enigma without
having recourse to the structural usage of the scapegoat that is the
universal key to the persecutor's representation of persecution. As soon
as it is a question of myth, especially that of Oedipus which is all the
more strengthened by the psychoanalytic, tragic, aesthetic, and hu·
manist qualities of the sacred in that it is actually quite transparent, the
idea of the scapegoat inevitably falls into the rut of theme and motif.
The spontaneous structuralism of demystified persecution disappears,
not to be found again.
Even Jean-Pierre Vernant, despite his "structuralism;' treats myth
like a flat surface covered with themes and motifs, among which is the
scapegoat or pharmakos. Vernant uses the Greek name, probably to

122

THE SCAPEG OAT

avoid being criticized for ethnocentrism b y his colleagues. 1 Admittedly,

pharmakos is a theme or motif in Greek culture, but traditional philolo­
gists are quick to note that this theme never exactly occurs in the myth
of Oedipus, and if it appears at all in the tragedy its appearance is
problematic; it is there because Sophocles, like Jean-Pierre Vernant
himself, "suspects something". I think Sophocles' suspicion goes quite
far, though it cannot be expressed directly within the framework of the
tragedy, which forbids the author to modify in any way the story he is
recounting. Aristoteles dixit. No doubt Sophocles is responsible for
whatever is exemplary in the portrayal of the stereotypes of persecution
in Oedipus Rex. He transforms the myth into a trial; he draws the stereo­
typical accusation out of the process of mimetic rivalry and strews his
text with suggestions either of a king who is suffering alone for all his
people or of one man, Oedipus himself, who alone is responsible instead
of the collective murderers of Laius. In fact the author insists that Laius
fell at the hands of many murderers. He shows that Oedipus counts on
this filet to clear himself but then Sophocles mysteriously refrains from
answering the questions he himself has posed. 2 Certainly, Sophocles
suspects something, but he never goes as far in revealing the structural
principle ofthe scapegoat as the Gospels or even the Prophets. Greek
culture forbids it. The myth does not burst apart in his hands and show
its inner workings. The trap closes on Oedipus, and the interpreters are
caught in the same trap, including Jean-Pierre Vernant, who sees only
theme and never states the real problem, the representation of the myth
as a whole and the system of persecution which has been shaken by the
tragedy but not really subverted or made to appear false as in the
Gospels.
What no one ever recognizes is that Oedipus could not be both
incestuous son and parricide and at the same time pharmakos. When we
speak of pharmakos we mean an innocent victim in the contaminated
Judaic and Christian sense. This is still not the same as the ethnocentric
sense since for Jews and Christians to speak of the pharmakos or scape­
goat as innocent is a truth we can only deny at the expense of the
demystification of Guillaume de Machaut and the denial of magical

123

thought. Either Oedipus is a scapegoat and not guilty of parricide and
incest, or he is guilty and is not, at least for the Greeks, the innocent
scapegoat that Jean-Pierre Vernant modestly calls pharmakos.
That the tragedy seems to move in conflicting directions is indica­
tive of its internal struggle; it can neither adhere to the myth nor reject
it in the way the Prophets, the Psalms, and the Gospels reject it. It is
this internal contradiction which tears it apart, violently, rather than the
impossible coexistence of the guilty son and the innocent scapegoat in
the false aesthetic harmony of humanist beatitudes, that gives the
tragedy its beauty.
By speaking of pharmakos rather than scapegoat, Jean-Pierre Ver­
nant hopes to escape the blame of those of his colleagues who are not in
the least sensitive to the aura of the victim released by the myth. But
why try to satisfy people with so little sensitivity? Jean-Pierre Vernant
is himself too sensitive for this and is almost as suspect in this as I am.
It never occurs to anyone to substitute pharmakos for scapegoat in the
case of Guillaume de Machaut. Even if Guillaume de Machaut had
written in Greek, which in a way is what he is doing when he replaces
plague with epydimie, I do not think we would consider that his attitude
toward the innocent who were persecuted was in any way influenced by
a pharmakos effect. We would still talk about scapegoats. The day we
understand the source of the myth of Oedipus, the genetic and struc­
tural mechanism that marks this myth, we shall have to admit that Oedi­
pus is a scapegoat. The distance is not great between this expression and
Jean-Pierre Vernant's pharmakos, 'but strong prejudices prevent many
from crossing it Jean-Pierre Vernant diverges from the myth as much in
speaking ofpharmakos as I do in speaking of scapegoat. But unlike Jean­
Pierre Vernant, I have not the slightest hesitation; I can completely
justify this divergence. I diverge neither more nor less from the myth
than the positivist philologists themselves do from Guillaume de
Machaut when they read him the way we all do. Why do our learned
positivists find acceptable in relation to Guillaume de Machaut what
they absolutely forbid in the name of textual accuracy in the case of
Oedipus and his myth? They cannot answer but I can answer for them.
They understand Guillaume de Machaut and do not understand the
myth of Oedipus; they do not understand what they hold most dear be­
cause they make a fetish of the great texts needed by Western humanism
to justify itself before the Bible and the Gospels. The same is true of
those who are violently opposed to ethnocentrism and share another

124

THE SCAPEGOAT

form of the same illusion. Why do they not condemn the mention of
scapegoat in relation to Guillaume de Machaut as ethnocentric?
If I risk boring my readers by returning to Guillaume it is not be­
cause of its intrinsic interest, but because our interpretation of him
clearly diverges from the text by the very met that it is radically struc­
tural. It is based on a principle that never appears in the text; it is
nonetheless legitimately untouchable, truly indestructible. Since I
never do more with the texts I am discussing than this interpretation
does with this text, it provides me with a marvelous counterproof, the
quickest, most intelligible, and surest means of sweeping away all the
false ideas that are so abundant today, not only in the areas of mythology
and religion but also in everything that involves interpretation. It re­
veals the deliquescence hidden beneath the radical pretensions of
present-day nihilism. The pernicious idea that there is no truth any­
where, and especially not in the texts we interpret, is triumphant every­
where. Against this notion we must brandish the truth we have all
extracted unhesitatingly from Guillaume de Machaut and the witch
trials. We must ask the nihilists whether they renounce this truth, too,
and whether they see all the accounts as the same, whether from the per­
spective of the persecutors or the victim.

CHAPTER ELEVEN

The Beheading of
Saint John the Baptist
CHRISTIANS AND anti-Christians are alike in their conception of origi­
nality. The romantics taught us that to be original is not to say the same
thing as anyone else; always to be creating new schools or new fashions;
to practice innovation like today's bureaucrats and idealists in a world
that is not even capable of creating new labels and alternates constantly
between "modern" and "new" for want of being able to imagine a third
alternative.
This concept of originality dominates the argument over the
Gospels. For the Gospels and, subsequently, Christianity to be truly
original, their subject matter must be different from that of all the other
religions. But it is not. For centuries ethnologists and historians of
religion have been demonstrating this; it is the source of their entire
knowledge. See how primitive the Gospels are, we are told in a hundred
different ways by all the most fashionable scholars. Look at that collec­
tive punishment in its fine setting, as in very primitive myths, look at
this business of a scapegoat. How curious! In the case of the so-called
ethnological myths there is never any question of violence. One is not
supposed to label myths and religions primitive and certainly not more
or less savage. This "ethnocentric problematic" can have no relevance.
Yet, as soon as the Gospels appear on the scene, it becomes possible
again and even commendable to use such terms.
I hasten to adopt this way of looking at things and applaud with
both hands the words of the ethnologists. They are right; the Gospels
are talking about the same event as the myths. They are talking about
the original murder that is found at the heart of all mythology, and they
are right about the most primitive myths resembling the Gospels most

1 26

THE SCAPEGOAT

closely, since they are generally explicit in their mention o fthe murder.
More developed myths, if they have not transfigured that murder, have
carefully erased it.
If the Gospels talk about the same event as the myths then they can­
not fail to be mythic, according to the ethnologists, who have overlooked
something. One can talk about the same murder without talking about
it in the same way. One can talk about it as murderers talk or one can talk
about it not as any ordinary victim talks but as does this incomparable
victim that is the Christ of the Gospels. One can call him an incompara­
ble victim without any sentimental piety or suspect emotion. He is
incomparable in that he never succumbs in any way, at any point, to the
perspective of the persecutor- neither in a positive way, by openly
agreeing with his executioners, nor in a negative way, by taking a posi­
tion of vengeance, which is none other than the inverse reproduction of
the original representation of persecution, its mimetic repetition . _
This total absence o f positive o r negative complicity with violence
is what is needed for a complete revelation ofits system of representation
and the system of every representation apart from the Gospels them­
selves. This is true originality; it is a return to the origin, a return that
revokes the origin as it reveals it The constant repetition of the origin
that characterizes the false originality of innovations is based on the con­
cealment and camouflage of that origin.
Christians have failed to understand the true originality of the
Gospels. They subscribe to their adversaries' concept. They believe that
the Gospels cannot be original unless they are talking about something
utterly remote from myths. They are therefore resigned to the Gospels
not being original. They espouse a vague syncretism, and their personal
beliefs are far behind Voltaire's. Or else they try in vain to prove exactly
the opposite of the ethnologists, but always within the same frame of
reference. They waste their efforts trying to show that the Passion is rad­
ically new in every respect. They tend to see in the trial of ]esus, in the
crowd's intervention, in the Crucifixion, an incomparable event in
itself, as a world event, whereas the Gospels say that Jesus is in the_�a.me
P()S_�tion as all past, present, and i'\lture..._vic!i�s. Theologians see in this
only more or less metaphysical and mystical metaphors. They do not
read the Gospels literally, and they tend to make a fetish of the Passion .
Unwittingly, they play the game of their adversaries and of all mythol­
ogy. They once more make sacred the violence that has been divested of
its sacred character by the Gospel text. The proof that this is unneces-

T H E B E H E A DING O F SAINT J O H N T H E BAPTIST

127

sary is that there is a second example of collective murder in this same
Gospel text The details are different, but it is identical to the Passion
in the mechanisms it employs and in the relationships among the
participants.
I refer to the murder ofJohn the Baptist. My analysis is based on the
account given by Mark. Although it is not lengthy, this text brings into
astonishing focus the mimetic desires, followed by mimetic rivalries,
that result in the final scapegoat effect. The text cannot be treated
merely as a reflection or double of the Passion. The differences are too
great to be able to conclude that the two accounts are from the same
source or that one is the faded replica of the other. The similarities are
better explained by the identical structure of the events portrayed and
by an absolute control, in each case, of a single concept of the individual
and collective relationships which comprises these two events, the
mimetic concept.
The murder of John the Baptist provides a sort of counterproof to
the analysis I have given of the Passion. It allows us to verify the sys­
tematic character of evangelical thought on the subject of collective
murder and its role in the genesis of non-Christian religion.
Herod wanted to take Herodias, the wife of his own brother, as his
second wife. The union was condemned by the prophet, whom Herod
imprisoned apparently as much to protect him as to punish him for his
audacity. Herodias demanded his head relentlessly. Herod did not want
to give in. Herodias, however, prevailed by having her daughter dance
for Herod and his guests at a banquet. At her mother's instruction and
with the encouragement of the guests, the daughter demands the head
of John the Baptist, which Herod dare not refuse (Mark 6 : 1 7-28).
Let us begin at the beginning:

Now it was this same Herod who had sent to have John arrested, and had him
chained up in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife whom he
had married. For John had told Herod, "It is against the law for you to have your
brother's wife."
It is not on the strict legality of the marriage that the prophet places
emphasis. In the sentence: It is against the law for you to have your

brother's mfe, the verb exein, to have, does not have a legal connotation.
Freudian-structuralist dogma favors a type of interpretation that does
not fit the Gospels. We should not introduce a petty legalism where it
never existed on the pretext of thrashing it The spirit and letter of the

U8

T H E SCAPEGOAT

Gospel text are opposed to it. What i s the real question? Sibling rivalry.
The brothers are condemned to rivalry by their very proximity; they
fight over the same heritage, the same crown, the same wife. It all begins
as in a myth with a story of enemy brothers. Do they have the same
desires because they are alike or are they alike because they have the
same desires? Is it the relationship in the myths that determines the twin
desires, or do the twin desires determine a likeness that is defined as
brotherly?
In our text both propositions seem true at the same time. Herod and
his brother constitute both the symbol of the desire that interests Mark
and a real historical example of the effects of that desire. Herod really
had a brother; he really took his wife, Herodias, from him. We know
from Joseph that the pleasure of supplanting his brother cost Herod
some serious repercussions; they are not mentioned in our text but they
are totally in the style of mimetic complications and, therefore, in the
spirit of prophetic injunction. Herod had a first wife whom he had to
repudiate, and the father of the abandoned wife decided to punish his
son-in-law's inconstancy by inflicting a stinging defeat on him.

To have Herodias, to carry her off, is forbidden to Herod not by vir­
tue of some formal rule but because his possession can only be at the
expense of a dispossessed brother. The prophet warns his royal listener
against the evil effects of mimetic desire. There is no illusion in the
Gospels about the possibility of arbitration between the brothers. This
warning should be compared with a very short but revealing text in the
Gospel of Luke:

A man in the crowd said to him, "Master, tell my brother to give me a share of
our inheritance:• "My friend;' he replied, "who appointed me your judge, or the
arbitrator of your claims?" (Luke 1 2 : 1 3- 1 4)

The brothers are divided over the indivisible heritage. Jesus
declares himself incompetent. The formula: " Who appointed me your
judge, or the arbitrator ofyour claims?" recalls a sentence from the begin·
ning of Exodus. Moses intervenes for the first time between an Egyptian
and a Hebrew. He kills the Egyptian, who is mistreating the Hebrew.
He intervenes a second time between two Hebrews and is asked: ''And
who appointedyou to be prince over us, andjudge? Do you intend to kill me
as you killed the Egyptian?" It is striking that Jesus for his part repeats
not what Moses says but what the Hebrew says when he challenges
Moses' authority. Jesus suggests that the question calls for no more of an

T H E B E H E A D I NG O F SAINT J O H N T H E BAPTIST

129

answer on his part than in Moses' case when it was asked. No one has
made him, Jesus, nor will make him, the judge of his fellow men to
decide their disputes.
Does this mean that Jesus is protesting the idea that he is charged
with a divine mission as Moses was eventually? Certainly not, but Jesus
suggests that his mission is very different from that of Moses. The time
for a national liberator and legislator is past. It is no longer possible to
separate the enemy brothers by a controlled violence that would put an
end to their violence. The Hebrew's challenge, which reminds Moses of
his murder the day before, is henceforth universally valid. No longer is
any distinction possible between legitimate and illegitimate violence.
There are only enemy brothers, and they can only be warned against
their mimetic desire in the hope that they will renounce it This is what
John does, and his warning recalls the preaching of the Kingdom of
God in the career of Jesus.
Except for the prophet, there are only enemy brothers and mimetic
twins in the text: the mother and daughter, Herod and his brother,
Herod and Herodias. The latter two names even suggest the twin quality,
phonetically and they are constantly repeated, one after the other, in the
beginning of our text, where the name of the dancer is not mentioned,
no doubt because it has nothing to serve as an echo; it adds nothing to
the relationship of mimetic effects.
The brother, or rather half-brother, with whom Herod disputes
Herodias, was not called Philip, as Mark mistakenly stated, but he too
was called Herod; he had the same name as his brother. Herodias finds
herself caught between two Herods. If Mark had known he probably
would have played on this homonymy. The historical reality is even
better than the text.
On the fringe of our text John's warning indicates the type of rela­
tionship that controls the whole narrative and ends convulsively in the
murder of the prophet. Desire festers and becomes overwrought because
Herod does not heed the prophetic warning, and everyone follows his
example. All the incidents and details of the text illustrate the successive
moments of this desire, each of them produced by the demented logic of
a higher bid nourished by the failure of the previous moments.
The proof that Herod desires above all to triumph over his brother
is that, once possessed, Herodias loses all direct influence over her hus­
band. She cannot get from him the death of an insignificant prophe t. To
achieve her ends Herodias must by means of her daughter establish a tri-

130

T H E SCAPEGOAT

angular configuration, similar to that which established her influence
over Herod, by making her a prize for the enemy brothers. Mimetic
desire is extinguished in one place only to reappear a little further away
in an even more virulent form.
Herodias feels herself denied and obliterated by the words of John.
This is true for her not as a human being but as a mimetic prize. She
herself is too consumed by mimeticism to be able to realize the distinc­
tion. By shielding the prophet from Herodias's vengeance Herod is
conforming to the laws ofdesire; he is verifying the prophetic announce­
ment, and the abandoned woman's hatred is redoubled. Attracted by
John because rejected by him, the desire becomes the desire of destruc­
tion; it glides immediately toward violence.
By imitating my brother's desire, I desire what he desires; we mutu­
ally prevent each other from satisfying our common desire. As resistance
grows on both sides, so desire becomes strengthened; the model becomes
increasingly obstructive and the obstacle becomes increasingly the
model, so that ultimately the desire is only interested in that which
opposes it It is only taken with the obstacles created by itself. John the
Baptist is that obstacle; inflexible, inaccessible to all attempts at corrup­
tion, it is that which fascinates Herod and, even more so, Herodias.
Herodias is always the coming into being of Herod's desire.
As mimeticism becomes more exacerbated it increases its dual
power of attraction and repulsion and communicates itself as hatred
more rapidly from one individual to another. The sequel provides an
extraordinary illustration of this law:
When the daughter of this same Herodias came in and danced, she delighted
Herod and his guests; so the king said to the girl, "Ask me anything you like and
I will give it you:' And he swore her an oath, "I will give you anything you ask,
even half my kingdom:' She went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask
for?" She replied, "The head ofJohn the Baptist:' The girl hurried straight back
to the king and made her request, "I want you to give me John the Baptist's
head, here and now, on a dish:' (M3rk 6:22-26)

Something very odd happens after Herod's offer, or rather, nothing
happens. Instead of mentioning the precious or foolish things that
young people are supposed to desire, Salome remains silent. Neither
Mark nor Matthew gives a name to the dancer. We call her Salome
because the historian Josephus speaks of a daughter of Herodias by that
name. Salome has no desire to formulate. This human being has no

T H E BE H EADING O F SAINT JOHN T H E BAPTIST

131

desire o fher own; men are strangers t o their desires; children don't know
how to desire and must be taught. Herod does not suggest anything to
Salome because he offers her everything and anything. That is why
Salome leaves him and goes to ask her mother what she should desire.
But does the mother really communicate her desire to her daughter?
Perhaps Salome is merely a passive intermediary, a good child who
obediently carries out her mother's terrible errands. She is much more
than that, as can be seen from her haste as soon as her mother has
spoken. Her uncertainty disappears and she changes entirely. Such
attentive readers as le pere Lagrange have remarked on the difference in
her appearance, but they have not understood its significance:

The girl hurried straight back to the king and made her request, "I want you to
give me John the Baptist's head, here and now, on a dish?'

Hurried, straight back, here and now. It is not unintentional that a
text that normally gives so few details provides so many signs of im­
patience and feverishness. Salome is worried that the king might be
sobered by the end of the dance and her departure and might go back on
his promise. And it is her desire that is worrying her; her mother's desire
has become her own. The fact that Salome's desire is entirely patterned
after another desire does nothing to lessen its intensity. On the contrary,
the imitation is even more frenetic than the original.
Herodias's daughter is a child. The Greek word that describes her
is not kore, young woman, but the diminutive korasion, little girl, as the
Jerusalem Bible correctly translates it. We must forget the concept of
Salome as a professional seducer. The genius of the Gospel text has
nothing in common with Flaubert's courtesan, the dance of the seven
veils, and other Orientalia. Although she is childish or, rather, because
she is a child, Salome changes immediately from innocence to the con­
vulsion of mimetic violence. A more luminous sequence cannot be
imagined. First the daughter's silence in response to the extravagant
offer of the king, then the mother's answer, the mother's desire, and,
finally, the daughter's adoption of that desire, the daughter's desire. The
child asks the adult not to fulfill some desire of hers but to provide her

with the desire she is lacking. This is a revelation of imitation as pure
essence of desire, which is too unfamiliar to be understood. It fits neither
our philosophical ideas of imitation nor our psychoanalytic theories of
desire.
There is to be sure something schematic in this revelation, achieved

132

T H E S C AP EG0 AT

at the expense of psychological realism. No matter how rapidly one
person can be infected by another's desire, it is hard to imagine that a
mother's brief answer to her daughter's question would be enough. All
the commentators had trouble with this schematic. Matthew was the
first to reject it. Between Herod's offer and Salome's response the whole
exchange between mother and daughter is omitted. Matthew recognized
its awkwardness but not its genius, or else he considered its expression
too elliptic to be retained. He says simply that the daughter is
"prompted" by her mother, which is a correct interpretation of what
happens in Mark, but deprives us of the striking spectacle of a Salome
suddenly transformed, mimetically, into a second Herodias .
After "appropriating" her mother's desire, the daughter is indistin­
guishable from her. The two women take turns playing the same role
with Herod. Our unshakable cult of desire prevents us from recognizing
the process of uniformization; it "scandalizes" our accepted notions.
Modern interpreters are equally divided between those who celebrate
only Herodias and those who celebrate only Salome. Each of them,
interchangeably, becomes the heroine of the most intense desire that is
for them totally unique, spontaneous, liberated, and liberating. The
force and simplicity of Mark's text, in contrast, show all this to be false.
It completely avoids the vulgarity (in the literal sense) of the analytical
tools created by psychoanalysis, sociology, ethnology, and the history of
religion.
By dividing themselves between Herodias and Salome modern
critics with their cult of desire are quietly reestablishing the truth that
their cult is meant to deny, the knowledge that desire, instead of creating
individuals, as it becomes increasingly mimetic, makes those it pos­
sesses more easily interchangeable and capable of substitution as its
intensity increases.
Before speaking of the dance we should explore a notion that pre­
vades our text without ever being mentioned explicitly: the notion of
scandal or the stumbling block. Derived from skadzein, which means to
limp, skandaJon designates the obstacle that both attracts and repels at
the same time. The initial encounter with the stumbling block is so fas­
cinating that one must always return to it, and each return becomes
more fascinating. 1
I recognize in scandal a rigorous definition of the mimetic process.

The modern sense only recaptures a glimmer of the evangelical mean­
ing. Desire clearly understands that, in desiring what another desires, it
makes a rival and an obstacle of this model. It would be wise to give up,
but if desire were wise it would not be desire. Finding only obstacles in
its path, it incorporates them in its vision of the desirable and brings
them into the foreground; it can no longer desire without them and cul­
tivates them avidly. Thus it becomes full of hatred for the obstacle, and
allows itself to be scandalized. This is the evolution revealed in the tran­
sition from Herod to Herodias and then to Salome.
To Herodias, John the Baptist is a scandal because he speaks the
truth, and there is no worse enemy of desire than truth. That is how it
can make a scandal of this truth; the truth itself becomes scandalous,
and that is scandal at its worst. Herod and Herodias keep the truth cap­
tive; they make it a kind of prize and compromise it in the dance of their
desire. Happy are those, Jesus says, for whom I am not a cause of scan­
dal. Scandal in the end always succeeds in investing and incorporating
what has most successfully eluded it, what should be most foreign to it.
Prophesy is one example and childhood another. My interpretation of
Salome reveals her as a child victim of scandal. Jesus' words on scandal
and childhood can be applied to her:

"Anyone who welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me. But
anyone who is an obstacle to bring down one of these little ones who have faith
in me would be better drowned in the depths of the sea with a great millstone
around his neck:' (Matt. 1 8:5-7)
The child inevitably chooses the closest adult as model. If he only
encounters people who are already scandalized and too devoured by
desire to be open, inevitably he will model his behavior on theirs; he will
become a mimetic replica of them and a grotesque caricature.
Herodias uses her own child to circumvent Herod and obtain his
consent to the death of the innocent man. How could Salome not be
scandalized? In an effort to protect herself from scandal the child sinks
deeper by making her mother's appalling desire her own. In the previous
quotation the drowning person with a millstone around his neck is a
figure of scandal. Like other metaphors it suggests a natural mechanism
of self-destruction rather than supernatural intervention. By becoming
a part of the vicious circle of scandal, men forge the destiny they de­
serve. Desire is a noose that each one ties around his own neck; it is
tightened at each tug of the scandalized. The physical equivalent of this

134

T H E SCAPEGOAT

process, the treadmill turned by mules, is less terrible than the process
itself. Hanging is another equivalent; by hanging himself, Judas inflicts
the punishment that prolongs his own evil, the scandal to which he is
prey, the mimetic jealousy that devours him.
Men create their own hell and help one another descend into it. Per·
dition is an equitable exchange because it results from reciprocal evil
desires and evil behavior. The only innocent victims are children on
whom scandal is imposed from the outside without any participation on
their part. Fortunately, all men were once children.
Scandal and the dance are in opposition. Scandal is what prevents
us from dancing. To enjoy the dance is to identify with the dancer and
escape the scandal that holds us a prisoner of Mallarme's ice or Sartre's

visqueux. If dance were merely a spectacle in the modern sense, a
simple image of the freedom we dream of, its effects would only be
imaginary or symbolic in the shallowest sense of modern aestheticism.
But dance has a different power. It exacerbates desire, rather than sup·
pressing it. What prevents us from dancing is not just the physical but
the dreadful intertwining of our desires which keep us tied to the
ground, and the other of desire always seems responsible for this misfor·
tune; we are all like Herodias, obsessed with some John the Baptist.
Even when the knots of desire are very individual and each has his own
model obstacle, still the mechanism is identical; this identity makes sub­
stitutions possible. Dance accelerates the mimetic process. It involves
all the guests at the banquet in the dance, converging all the desires on
the one object, the head on the platter, the head of]ohn the Baptist on
Salome's platter.
John the Baptist is first the scandal of Herodias and then becomes
the scandal of Salome, who, through her artistic power, transmits the
scandal to all the spectators. She gathers all the desires together and
directs them toward the victim chosen for her by Herodias. The inex­
tricable knot of desire must be loosened at the end of the dance, and this
requires the death of the victim, who, for the time being, incarnates that
desire, for mimetic reasons (no matter how remote), reasons that are
almost always insignificant, except, perhaps, here and in the case of
Jesus when the just denunciation of this desire unleashes the fatal
mechanism.
To say that the dance pleases not only Herod but also all his guests
is to say that they are all possessed by Salome's desire. In the head of
John the Baptist they do not really identify what the dancer claims, or

T H E B E H EADING O F SAINT JOHN T H E BAPTIST

135

scandal i n general - the philosophical concept of scandal, which does
not exist- but each one sees his own scandal, the object ofhis desire and
hatred. The collective "yes!" to the beheading should not be interpreted
as merely a polite gesture of acquiescence. The guests are all under
Salome's spell. Mimeticism again. The power of the dance resembles
that of the shaman who leads his patients to think that he has extracted
the harmful substance from their bodies. They were possessed by some·
thing that chained them and the dance frees them. The dancer can make
the lame dance because her dance exorcises the demon that possesses
them. She enables them to exchange all that wearies and torments them
for the head of John the Baptist. She not only reveals the demon that
possesses them but she also carries out the act of vengeance of which
they dream. By espousing the violent desire of Salome, all the guests feel
as if they are satisfying their own desire. Everyone shares the same
frenzy toward the model obstacle, and they all willingly mistake the ob·
ject because the proposed object feeds their appetite for violence. It is
not Hegelian negativity or the impersonal death of the philosophers
that guarantees the symbolic quality of the prophet's head, but the
mimetic contagion of collective murder.
There is a popular legend in which Salome dies in the course of a
dance on ice. The dancer slips and, as she falls, her neck hits a sharp
piece of ice, which beheads her.2 Even though in the Gospel text the
dancer keeps her balance perfectly and, as a result, obtains the head that
she desires, yet here in the end she fails and pays for her failure with her
own head. This retribution seems to be carried out without an inter·
mediary; it is vengeance without avengers. But we have in the ice, the
mirror or reflection, an image of the others, the spectators, and the
ground is wonderfully slippery, suitable for the most spectacular perfor·
mance. Her admirers urge the dancer to defy the laws of gravity in
increasingly daring fashion, but in an instant they can become a fatal
trap, witness and cause of the fall from which the artist does not recover.
If the dancer does not control the desires, the public immediately
turns on her, there is no one else to become the sacrificial victim. Like
a lion-tamer, the master of ritual unleashes monsters that will devour
him unless he remains in control through constantly renewed efforts.
The legend is separated from the Gospel by its dimension of vengeance,

but it confirms that the connection exists in the popular mind between
John's murder, the dance and the scandal, the loss of balance that is the
opposite of the successful dance. In short it verifies the mimetic reading,
I might even add for the pleasure of my critics, the simp/ism, sys­
tematism, and dogmatism of this reading, in that it leaves no stone
unturned in a prodigious shortcut but not without re-creating the myth
that Mark removed since it replaces the other, the double, the scan­
dalous rival, explicit in the evangelical text, with one of its most com­
mon mythic symbols: ice, the mirror.
Scandal is the unobtainable that desire wishes to obtain, the abso­
lutely unavailable that it wants absolutely at its disposition. Because it
is lighter, more portable and manageable, the head becomes a better
representation once it is severed from the body, especially when placed
on a dish. The thin plate of metal slipped under John's head stresses the
icy cruelty of the dancer. It transforms the head into an accessory of the
dance but, above all, it conjures up the material expression of the ulti­
mate nightmare of desire. We can recognize a certain similarity with the
primitive obsession with an antagonist's head that was demanded by
ritual, the head of a member of a neighboring tribe, for example, that
was locked into a relationship of mimetic rivalry with the murderers. In
primitive tribes these heads are sometimes embalmed, a process that
shrinks them and turns them into a kind of trinket. This refinement
parallels the horrible desire of Salome.
Tradition recognizes Salome as a great artist, and powerful tradi­
tions are never established without reason. But what is that reason? The
dance is never described. There is nothing original about Salome's
desire since it is copied from Herodias. Even the words belong to Hero­
dias. Salome adds only one thing, the idea of the dish. "I want you to
give me the head of John the Baptist on a dish:' Herodias had men­
tioned the head but not the dish. The dish is the only new element and
the only detail that truly belongs to Salome. If a textual reason for the
prestige of Salome is needed, that is where it must be found. There is no
other justification. Unquestionably, everything rests on that dish. That
is the most famous part of the scene in Mark. That is what is remem­
bered when all else is forgotten. We cannot ignore the met that in mod­
ern times we identify "culture" by such signs as these. The idea is
scandalous, striking; its very coarseness contributes to its subtlety- it is
the idea of a decadent artist.
But is it really an original idea in the modern sense of novelty? On

THE BEH EADING OF SAINT JOHN THE BAPTIST

closer examination its apparent originality again dissolves into mimesis.
When Herodias gives her daughter the answer: "The head of John the
Baptist;' she is not thinking of decapitation. In French as in Greek, to
ask for someone's head is to demand his death. The part is taken for the
whole. Herodias's answer does not refer to a precise method of execu­
tion. The text has already mentioned the desire of Herodias in neutral
terms that do not suggest any fixation with her enemy's head: "As for
Herodias, she was furious with him and wanted to kill him?' One cannot
conclude from this that she wanted to hold his head in her hands, that
she desired the physical object. Even in countries where beheading is
customary, to demand someone's head must be understood rhetorically,
whereas Salome takes it literally. She does not do so intentionally. Only
an adult can make such distinctions. This head is the most wonderful
day of her life.
The beheading of]ohn the Baptist is one thing; holding his head in
her hands is something else. Salome wonders what she can do with it.
A freshly beheaded head needs to be put somewhere, and the practical
solution is to put it on a platter. This idea is no more than a common­
sense reaction. Salome takes the words too-literally to convey the mes­
sage accurately. A too-literal interpretation results in a misinterpretation
through a lack of understanding. The inaccuracy of the copy is a result
of an excessive concern for accuracy. What appears to be most creative
in the role of Salome is really what is most mechanical and hypnotic in
the submission to the chosen model.
All great aesthetic ideas are the same - narrowly, obsessively imita­
tive. Traditionally, art is only spoken ofin terms of mimesis. The passion
with which we deny this is suspect, since art has rightly withdrawn
from our world. By discouraging imitation we are not eliminating it but
forcing it into the ridiculous fads and ideologies that make up our con­
temporary attempts at innovation. Our desire for originality ends in
insignificant efforts. Instead of renouncing the notion of mimesis we
should expand it to include desire or, perhaps, desire should be ex­
panded to mimesis. By separating mimesis from desire philosophy has
deformed them both, and we remain prisoners of this mutilation that
perpetuates all the false dichotomies of modern culture; between the
aesthetic, for example, the mythical, and the historical.
The text says nothing about the actual dance; it only says: "and
danced?' Yet it must say something in order to exert the fascination it has
always exerted over Western art. Salome dancing was already portrayed

138

T H E S C A P E G OAT

o n Romanesque capitals, and her portrayal has continued since then in
an increasingly diabolic and scandalous form as the world sinks deeper
into its own scandal.
The space meant for "description" in modern texts is usurped by the
antecedents and consequences of the dance. It all reflects back to the sig­
nificant moments of a single mimetic game. Thus mimesis occupies the
space, not in the sense of a realistic copying of objects but, rather, in the
relationships controlled by mimetic rivalries. The acceleration of this
vortex produces the "victimage" mechanism that brings about its end.
All the mimetic effects are pertinent in relation to the dance; they
are already effects ofdance but t hey are not gratuitous, they are not there
for "aesthetic reasons:• It is the relationships among the participants
that interest Mark. The dancer and the dance are reciprocally genera­
tive. The infernal progress of the mimetic rivalries, the becoming simi­

lar of all the characters, the progress of the sacrificial crisis toward its
denouement in a victim are all part of Salome's dance. It must be this
way: art is never other than the reproduction of this crisis or denoue­
ment in a more or less concealed form. Everything begins with sym­
metrical confrontations that are ultimately resolved in the rounds of the
victims.
The text in its entirety has something in common with the dance.
As it follows the mimetic effects carefully and as simply as possible, it
must go back and forth between one character and another, designing a
kind of ballet in which each dancer comes forward in turn before disap­
pearing once more into the group to play his role in the sinister final
apotheosis. But the existence of a calculating intelligence will certainly
be noted. Herod still protects John, but Herodias, like a spider in its
web, waits for a suitable occasion:

An opportunity came on Herod's birthday when he gave a banquet for the
nobles of his court, for his army officers and for the leading figures in Galilee.
The suitable occasion, Herod's birthday, has a ritual character; it is
a feast that recurs every year; festive, or ritual, activities take place on
the occasion; the community is assembled around a banquet; the specta­
cle of dance at the end of the banquet also has a ritual character. All the
institutions that Herodias puts to use against John are ritual by nature.
Like the conspiracy of the priests in the Passion story, Herodias's
plot plays only a secondary role: it contributes somewhat to the accelera­
tion by moving in the direction of desire and mimesis like ritual itself.

T H E BEHEADING O F SAINT JOHN T H E BAPTIST

139

An inferior, too differentiated, understanding imagines that Herodias is
manipulating all the desires, which is what Herodias herself thinks. A
superior, more mimetic, and less differentiated understanding perceives
that Herodias herself is being manipulated by her desire. All the activi­
ties mentioned by the text are also found in ritual and usually culminate
in a sacrificial immolation. John's murder occupies the place and mo­
ment of sacrifice. All the textual elements could therefore be read in a
strictly ritual key, but such a reading would have no explanatory value.
According to some bygone ethnologists, the ritual aspects clarify a text
such as ours. In fact they increase the mystery because of a lack of un­
derstanding of the rites and the reason for their existence. It often hap­
pens in the human sciences that explanatory value is given to the most
opaque details precisely because of their opaqueness. Anything that
provides no hold for the interpreter feels like a smooth rock; and with no
crack where doubt may be insinuated, its very obscurity is taken for
clarity.
Far from neglecting the ritual and institutional aspects of the text,
by using desire to interpret them I am creating the only framework that
makes ritual intelligible. It not only resembles the final stages of the mi­
metic crisis that are resolved spontaneously by the scapegoat mecha­
nism, but it is also a complete replica of the crises from which it cannot
be distinguished. This replication is perfectly feasible because, as we
have seen, ritual is the mimetic repetition of an original mimetic crisis.
Because there is nothing original about the ritual dimension except its
concealed origin it fits smoothly into the history of desire outlined in
our text. It is totally mimesis, imitation, the scrupulous repetition of the
crisis. The rite does not provide any real solution, it merely recopies the
solution that occurred spontaneously. There is therefore no structural
difference between the rite itself and the spontaneous, natural course of
the mimetic crisis.
Instead ofcurbing or interrupting the mimetic play ofdesires, ritual
activity fosters and channels it in the direction of designated victims.
Each time the faithful feel themselves threatened by authentic mimetic
discord they engage in it voluntarily; they mimic their own conflicts and
use their own wiles to bring about a sacrificial resolution that will
achieve agreement at the victim's expense.
Our reading is thus confirmed; ritual and the arts it inspires are
mimetic by nature and function mimetically; they do not have a verifia­
ble specificity. Does this mean that there is no difference between them

140

THE SCAPEGOAT

and the spontaneous crisis or Herodias's complicated maneuver? Am I
confusing all these things? Certainly not. Authentic rites are different
from authentic disorder by virtue of the unanimous opposition to the
victim that is then perpetuated under the aegis of a victim mythically
restored and made sacred.

Rite is the reenactment of mimetic crises in a spirit of voluntary reli­
gious and social collaboration, a reenactment in order to reactivate the
scapegoat mechanism for the benefit of society rather than for the detri­
ment of the victim who is perpetually sacrificed. For this reason, in the
diachronic evolution of rites the disorders that precede and necessitate
the sacrifice are invariably attenuated whereas the festive and convivial
aspects increase in importance.
Even the most weakened ritual institutions are inclined toward
sacrifice. A crowd stuffed with food and drink wants something extraor­
dinary, a spectacle of eroticism or violence, preferably both at the same
time. Herodias knows enough about ritual to use its power in the pro­
motion of her murderous scheme. She inverts and perverts the ritual
function because the victim's death interests her more than the commu­
nity's reconciliation. The symbols of the authentic ritual function are
still present in our text, but in purely vestigial form.
Herodias mobilizes the ritual forces and directs them knowingly
toward the victim of her hate. By perverting the rite she restores mimesis
to its former virulence and redirects sacrifice back to its murderous ori­
gins. She reveals the scandal at the heart of every religious sacrificial in­
stitution, playing a role similar to that of Caiaphas in the Passion.
Herodias in herself is not important. She is only an instrument of the
revelation and reveals its "paradoxical" nature by the use of ritual that
is revealing in its perversity. It is John's opposition to her marriage with
Herod-"/t is against the law for you to have your 1:1rother's wife" that
-

turns Herodias against the prophet. But, in principle, ritual mystifica­
tion always involves this occultation of mimetic desire by means of the
scapegoat. Herodias and Caiaphas could be defined as living allegories
of the rite that is forced to return to its nonritual origins, the undis­
guised murder, by the power of the revelation that forces it out ofits reli·
gious and cultural hiding places.
I speak of Mark's text as if he were always telling the truth, and, in
effect, he is. Certain aspects, however, strike the reader as legendary.
They are vaguely reminiscent of a black fairy-tale with an unhappy end­
ing. There is something of this in the relationship of Salome with her

T H E B E H E A DING O F S A I NT J O H N T H E B AP T I S T

141

mother, in the mixture of horror and childish submission. There is also
something of it in the excessive character of the exorbitant offer of
recompense to the dancer. Herod does not have a kingdom to divide. To
tell the truth, he was not a king but a tetrarch, and his very limited
powers were totally dependent on Roman goodwill.
Commentators look for literary sources. In the book of Esther,
King Ahasuerus makes an offer to the heroine that is similar to Herod's
(Esther 5 : 6) . Both Mark and Matthew could have been influenced by
this text . But the theme of an exorbitant offer is so common in legends
that it could have been in the minds of Mark and Matthew without
reference to any particular text . It would be more interesting to study the
significance of this theme. In folktales the hero, when put to the test or
performing some feat, often unexpectedly shows some unappreciated
quality. The ruler who sets the test is all the more astounded by the
hero's success because he has been impervious to his charm for so long.
He then makes him an exorbitant offer: his kingdom or, what amounts
to the same thing, his only daughter. If the offer is accepted it transforms
one who has nothing into one who possesses everything and vice versa.
If a king's person is inseparable from his possessions and his kingdom,
then the donor is literally giving his being to the receiver. By dispossess­
ing himself, the donor makes the receiver another self. He gives him
everything that makes him what he is, and he keeps nothing for himself.
If the offer only concerns half the kingdom, as here, the sense basically
remains the same. A Salome who possessed half of Herod would be the
same as the other half, Herod himself. There would only be one person
interchangeable between the two people.
Despite his riches and titles the donor is in an inferior position. An
offer to a dancer to dispossess us is the same as asking her to possess us.
The exorbitant offer is the fascinated spectator's response. It expresses
the strongest desire of all, the desire to be possessed. Disoriented by this
desire, the subject tries to become a part of the orbit of the sun that
dazzles him, and he literally becomes a "satellite?'
Possession in this context must be understood in the technical sense
of the trance practiced in certain cults. Like Jean-Michel Oughourlian,
we must recognize a mimetic manifestation too intense for the perspec­
tive of alienation, which has been valuable enough, until now, to remain
relevant. Alienation implies the vigilance of a self, a subject that is not
completely obliterated by this experience and thus experiences it as
alienation or slavery. As for the possessed, the invasion by this other, the

142

THE SCAPEGOAT

mimetic model is so total that neither person nor thing can resist it and
the perspective becomes inverted. There is no longer a self to be
alienated; there is only the other, and the other is at home and there to
stay. 3
The language of the offer is both that of an oath and that ofincanta­
tory prayer. It is the language of extreme mimesis. Salome becomes the
deity invoked by Herod when he repeats the same words and offers the
same formulas:
"Ask me anything you like and I will give it you:' And he swore her an oath, "I
will give you anything you ask, even half my kingdom:'

The person making the offer always has an object or, rather, a per­
son to whom he is particularly attached and whom he wants to keep.
Unfortunately, when he formulates his offer, he does not mention this
person. He may have actually forgotten him in the frenzy of his desire,
or he may fear that his generosity would seem diminished by excluding
anything at all that he possessed. Perhaps he does not mention this
object for fear of making it desirable. For whatever reason, the spirit of
the trance triumphs and the offer is made without any restriction. It
would not seem to matter. Compared with the immense riches in the
balance, one person could not be considered to have enough value to be
chosen in preference to all else.
And yet that is always what happens. Invariably the demand is
directed toward that one insignificant being who should not be of in­
terest to anyone inasmuch as no one has mentioned him. Can we lay the
blame on destiny, fate, the narrator's perversity, Freud's unconscious?
No, there is a simple and perfect explanation.:__l!l!�-�tic desi.re. What
makes the object valuable is not its true price but the desires that are
already focused on it. Desire need not be pointed out to become visible.
Mimetic desires hide their objects from us, since they themselves are
hidden, but they cannot hide anything from each other. They seem to
defy all the rules of probability by making people either blind or too
clairvoyant.
Herod thinks he has concealed his interest in John by throwing him
into prison. But Herodias has understood the situation perfectly. The
prophet makes much more noise and attracts much more attention from
the depths of the prison where the king thought he had hidden biro.
3. See Jean-Michel Oughourlian, Un Mime nommi disir (Paris: Grassel, 1 982).

Mimetic desire is most capable of tying the great knots of traditional
drama, which is why real tragedies so closely resemble daily life, if only
we knew how to find ourselves in them, or conversely, lose ourselves
completely.
An exorbitant offer always receives an apparently modest answer
that costs more to satisfy than all the kingdoms of the universe. The
value of the demand cannot be measured against worldly things. It is
essential to understand that we are dealing with a sacrifice. The demand
represents the hardest sacrifice for the one who must give up a cherished
being. The one who claims the victim is a kind of idol, a Salome, a half­
monstrous divinity. The freedom, well-being, and life of the abandoned
person are involved. Above all, the demand involves the spiritual integ­
rity of all those concerned. Herod's integrity is already compromised
and is destroyed as the prophet is destroyed by the collective murder.
The text is therefore written in opposition to sacrifice, as are all the
great legends, such as the story of Faust or Don Juan, which contain
variations on the theme of the exorbitant offer and the sacrificial
demand.
Thus the few modern myths are not real myths because they do not
accept the final sacrifice without reservation as do real myths. Instead of
reflecting the vision ofpersecution, they refuse this form of sacrifice and
denounce it as an abomination. In this they are influenced by the
Gospels.
We always want to eliminate the essential from these legends be­
cause it disturbs us. The notion of sacrifice irritates us; we see it as the
remains of piety that must be immediately eradicated. We ridicule the
idea of the immortal soul claimed by Mephistopheles, and are contemp­
tuous of the Commander's statue and his festin de pierre. We do not
recognize in this stumbling block our last communal meaL Modern
society's last link to religion is found in the idea of scandal so patiently
cultivated by scholars. Yet here we remove all flavor from it by our banal
treatment.
By removing all traces of sacrifice, the one concept that is worth the
effort of investigation, since it controls everything, modern authors
transform Faust and Don Juan into merely an imaginary consum­
erism of women and riches. Notice that this does not prevent them from
endlessly criticizing our so-called consumer society, no doubt because i t
is not purely imaginary a n d because i t has the advantage o f supplying
what is demanded ofit.

144

T H E S C A P E G OAT
The essential in our text i s the obvious connection between collec·

tive mimeticism, the murder ofJohn the Baptist, and the state of trance
brought about by the dance. The dance is identified with the pleasure
of the text, of Herod and of the guests. "When the daughter of this same
Herodias came in and danced, she delighted Herod and his guests:' This
pleasure must be interpreted in a stronger sense than Freud's pleasure
principle; it has the effect of a spell. When the possessed person aban·
dons himself to the mimetic model, its genius takes possession of him
and "rides" him, as is often said in such cases; it begins to dance with
him.
Submerged in mimeticism the subject loses awareness of self and
purpose. Instead of rivaling the model he is transformed into a harmless
marionette; all opposition is abolished and the contradiction of desire
dissolves. But where now is the obstacle that was barring the way and
pinning him down? The monster must be lurking somewhere; fur the
experience to be complete the monster must be found and destroyed. At
this moment there is always an appetite for sacrifice that requires
appeasement, a scapegoat to destroy, or a victim to behead. At this
moment of greatest intensity sacrificial mimeticism reigns supreme. For
this reason truly profound texts always reach this point.
Mimeticism, at this point, absorbs all the dimensions that might
compete with it at a less intense level- sexuality, ambition, psychology,
sociology, and ritual itself. This does not mean that by taking the fure·
front mimeticism removes or "reduces" these other dimensions. They
are all implicit in the mimetic analysis and can all become explicit in the
same way as the dimension of ritual.
The benefactor never anticipates the demand to be made. He is
painfully surprised but incapable of resisting. On learning that the
dancer's demand is for the head ofJohn "the king was deeply distressed
but, thinking of the oaths he had sworn and of his guests he was reluc­
tant to break his word to her?' Herod's desire is to save John. His desire
belongs to an earlier stage of the mimetic process. Herod wants to pro·
tect John's life whereas Salome wants to destroy it. The desire becomes
more murderous as it progresses and affects more individuals such as the
crowd of guests. It is this lowest desire that triumphs. Herod does not
have the courage to say no to his guests, whose number and prestige
intimidate him. In other words he is controlled by mimesis. The guests
comprise all the elite of Herod's world. A little earlier in the text Mark
took care to enumerate them by categories: "the nobles of his court, his

T H E B E H E A D I N G O F S A I N T J O H N T H E B A P T I ST

145

army officers and the leading figures in Galilee!' He is trying to suggest
to us their enormous potential for mimetic influence; similarly, the
Passion story enumerates all the forces of this world that form a coalition
against the Messiah. The crowd and the rulers join and meld. It is the
crowd that provides the supplement of mimetic energy necessary for
Herod's decision. The same energy motivates our text, and it is clearly
mimetic in nature.
If Mark describes this in detail, he does so not for the pleasure of
telling the story but to clarify the decision to remove the prophet's head.
The guests all react identically. At the supreme stage of mimetic crisis
they provide the type of crowd that alone can intervene decisively.
When the crowd is unanimously murderous the decision always rests
with it. Subjected to such formidable pressure Herod can only ratify

nolens volens the decision of the crowd, just as Pilate does a little later.
By yielding to this pressure he loses himself in the crowd; he is no more
than the least of its members.
There is no need to look for a psychology of the principal characters
either. There is no need to believe that John and Jesus are dead because
they fell into the hands of particularly m alevolent schemers or particu­
larly weak rulers. All of human weakness when faced with the tempta­
tion of scapegoats must be revealed and branded. The prophet dies
because he has revealed the truth of desire to people who do not want
to listen to him. No one ever wants to listen. But the truth he proffers
is not sufficient reason for his murder: it is one more, and the most
ironic, preferential sign for the selection of a victim. It does not con­
tradict the very problematic character of the mimetic choice that is
vividly illustrated by the delay in the choice of victim until after the
dance.
The lengthy deferral of the choice allows Mark to illustrate both the
alpha and omega of desire, its mimetic beginning and its equally mi­
metic conclusion with a victim. The "What shall I ask?" of Salome indi­
cates that, at that moment, Herodias or anyone else could designate
anyone at all. The ultimate designation does not prevent the victim from
being passionately adopted at first by Salome and then by all the guests.
At this stage even the most resolute of tyrants can no longer effectively
resist.
The fact that mimeticism inevitably becomes unanimous is what
int erests the Gospels. The unanimous mimeticism of the scapegoat is
the true ruler of human society. One person's beheading can sometimes

146

THE SCAPEGOAT

cause universal agitation and sometimes calm it. How can that be? The
convergence on John's head is only a mimetic illusion, but its unani­
mous character achieves a real calm from the moment when the actual
reason has been lost in the widespread agitation. The diffusion of
mimeticism at the height of its intensity guarantees the absence of any
real object for the desire. Beyond a certain threshold hate exists without
cause. It no longer has need of cause or pretext; there remain only inter­
twined desires, buttressed against one another. If these desires are
divided and set in opposition as they focus on an object they wish to
preserve -alive, in order to monopolize it, as in Herod's case, when he
imprisons the prophet - then by becoming purely destructive these
same desires may be reconciled. This is the terrible paradox of human
desires. They can never be reconciled in the preservation of their object
but only through its destruction; they can only find agreement at the
expense of a victim. "And immediately the king sent a soldier of the
guard and gave the orders to bring his head. He went and beheaded him
in the prison, and brought his head on a dish, and gave it to the girl; and
the girl gave it to her mother?'
Whoever reproaches men for their desire is a living scandal for
them, the only thing in their opinion that keeps them from being happy.
We think no differently today. Being alive, the prophet disturbed all
their relations, and, in his death, he facilitates them by becoming this
inert and docile object that is circulated on Salome's platter; the guests
offer it to one another like the food or drink at Herod's banquet. It
becomes the astonishing spectacle that both prevents us from doing
what must not be done and incites us to do what it is fitting to do, it is
the sacrificial beginning of all such exchanges. The truth of all religious
institutions can be found clearly in this text, the truth of myths, rituals,
and interdicts. But the text itself does not carry out what it reveals; it
sees nothing divine in the mimeticism that gathers men together. It has
infinite respect for the victim but is careful not to make him divine.
What interests me most about a murder like John's is its fundamen­
tally religious, rather than cultural, force. I want to show how Mark's
text makes explicit reference to this religious force. This is perhaps what

is most extraordinary about it. The passage I am thinking of comes not

at the end of the story but before it. The account is presented as a klnd
offlashback. Herod is impressed by Jesus' growing reputation:

Meanwhile King Herod had heard about him, since by now his name was well·
known. Some were saying, "John the Baptist has risen from the dead, and that

T H E B EHEADING O F SA INT JOHN T H E BAPTIST

147

is why miraculous powers are at work in him:' Others said, "He is Elijah;"
others again, "He is a prophet, like the prophets we used to have:' (Mark
6 : 1 4- 1 6)
Of all the rumored hypotheses, Herod chose the first, according to
which Jesus was the resurrected John the Baptist. The text suggests the
reason for his choice: Herod thinks that John the Baptist is resurrected
because of the role he himself played in his violent death. Persecutors
cannot believe in the definitive death of their victims. The resurrection
and consecration of the victims are above all phenomena of persecution,
the perspective of the persecutors themselves on the violence in which
they have participated.
The Gospels of Mark and Matthew do not take the resurrection of
John the Baptist seriously, and they do not intend for us to take it seri­
ously either. But they ultimately reveal a process of consecration
strangely similar to that which constitutes the main object of the Gospel
text, the Resurrection ofJesus and the proclamation of his div�nity. The
Gospels are quite aware of the resemblances, but feel no discomfort;
they have not the slightest doubt. Modern believers scarcely comment
on the false resurrection of John the Baptist because, in their eyes, it is
insufficiently distinguished from that ofJesus himself; ifthere is no rea­
son to believe in the resurrection of John, then there is no reason to
believe in that of Jesus.
For the Gospels, the difference is obvious. The type of resurrection
we are talking about is imposed on the mystified persecutors by their
own persecution. Christ's resurrection, on the contrary, succeeds in
freeing us of these illusions and superstitions. The Paschal resurrection
can only really triumph in the ruins of all other religions based on col­
lective murder.
The false resurrection ofJohn certainly has the sense that I have given
it, for it is mentioned a second time in a context that leaves no doubt.

When Jesus came to the region ofCaesarea Philippi he put this question to his
disciples, "Who do people say the Son ofMan is?" And they said, "Some say he
is John the Baptist, some Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophetS:'
"But you;' he said, "who do you say I am?" Then Simon Peter spoke up, "You
are the Christ;' he said, "the Son of the living God:' Jesus replied, "Simon son
ofJonah, you are a happy man! Because it was not flesh and blood that revealed
this to you but my Father in heaven. So I now say to you: You are Peter and on
this rock I will build my Church. And the gates of the underworld can never
hold out against it. (Matt. 1 6 : 1 3- 1 8)

148

T H E SCAPEGOAT
At the time of this profession of faith John the Baptist is already

dead. All the personages that the crowd identified in Jesus are already
dead. This means that the crowd believes all to be resurrected in the per­
son of Jesus. Thus it is a belief similar to that of Herod, an imaginary
belief in the Resurrection. Luke makes it even more explicit: Jesus, he
writes, is believed to be one of the ancient prophets resurrected.
The reference to the powers of death (or the gates of Hades) seems to
me to be significant. It indicates more than just that evil shall not over­
come good. In it can be recognized an allusion to the religion of vio­
lence, which can only be a religion of the dead and of death. The words
of Heraclitus come to mind: Dionysus is the same as Hades.
Children recognize the difference between the two religions because
violence makes them afraid and Jesus does not make them afraid, but the
wise and clever cannot see the difference. They knowledgeably compare
themes and, because they find the same themes everywhere, even if they
believe themselves to be structuralists, they fail to recognize the real
structural difference. They do not see the difference between the hidden
scapegoat that John the Baptist represents for those who are ready to
worship him after killing him, and the revealed and revealing scapegoat
that is the Jesus of the Passion.
Peter recognizes the difference, but this does not prevent his several
lapses into the mimetic behavior of all mankind. The extraordinary
solemnity of Jesus in this passage shows that the difference Peter per­
ceives will not be seen by all men. The Gospels insist, in fact, on the
paradox of faith in the resurrection of Jesus, which, for someone not
informed by that faith, is viewed with the same extreme skepticism as
apparently very similar phenomena.

CHAPTER TWELVE

Peter's Denial
JEsus QUOfES THE prophet Zechariah to his disciples in order to de­

scribe for them what the effect of the Passion will be: "I shall strike the
shepherd and the sheep will be scattered" (Zech. 1 3 :7; Mark 1 4 :27).
The dispersal takes place immediately after his arrest. The only one not
to run away is Peter. He follows the procession at a distance and makes
his way into the courtyard of the High Priest while Jesus is being bru­
tally interrogated inside the palace. He manages to enter the courtyard
through the auspices of someone familiar with the place, "another disci­
ple" who joined him. The "other disciple" is not mentioned by name
but is meant without a doubt to be the apostle John.
Mark tells us that Peter had followed Jesus at a distance, "right into
the courtyard of the high priest; and he was sitting with the guards, and
warming himselfat the fire" (Mark 1 4 : 54). Nothing is more natural than
this fire on a March evening in Jerusalem. ''Now the servants and
officers had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were
standing and warming themselves; Peter also was with them, standing
and warming himself' (John 1 8 : 1 8).
Peter i s already doing what the others are doing, and for the same
reasons. He is imitating the others, but there is nothing remarkable
about this. It is cold and everyone is huddled around the fire. Peter joins
them. At first we are not aware of what should be noticed. Yet the con­
crete details are all the more significant in a text that provides so few.
Three cf the four Gospels mention this fire. There must be a reason for
this, and we should try to discover it in Mark's text, which is considered
the most primitive.
While Peter is standing below in the courtyard one of the maids of

1 50

T H E SCAPEG OAT

the high priest arrives. Seeing Peter warming himself, she looks into his
face and says:

"You too.were with Jesus, the man from Nazareth?' But he denied it. "I do not
know, I do not understand, what you are talking about;' he said. And he went
out into the forecourt. The servant girl saw him and again started telling the
bystanders, "This fellow is one of them?' But again he denied it. A little later
the bystanders themselves said to Peter, ''You are one of them for sure! Why, you
are a Galilean?' But he started calling down curses on himself and swearing, "I
do not know the man you speak of?' At that moment the cock crew for the
second time, and Peter recalled how Jesus had said to him, "Before the cock
crows twice, you will have disowned me three times?' And he burst into tears.
(Mark 14:66-72)
At first we think that Peter is a brazen liar. Peter's denial has forced
him to that lie, but there is no such thing as a pure and simple lie, and
this one, on second thought, is not that simple. What is actually being
asked of Peter? He is being asked to admit that he was with Jesus. But
since the recent arrest there are no longer disciples or community sur­
rounding Jesus. Neither Peter nor anyone else is truly with Jesus any
longer. As we know, existentialists recognize in "the being with" an
important modality of being. Martin Heidegger calls it the Mitsein,
which may be literally translated the being with.
Jesus' arrest seems to have destroyed any possible future being with

Jesus, and Peter seems to have lost all memory of having been. He
answers as if in a dream, like a man who does not really know where he
is: "/ do not kn(11J), I do not understand, what you are talking about?' He
may well not have understood. He is dispossessed and destitute, reduced
to a vegetablelike existence, controlled by elemental reflexes. He feels
cold and turns to the fire. Elbowing one's way to the fire and stretchin g
hands toward it with the others is to act like one of them, as if one
belongs with them. The simplest gestures have their logic, and that
logic is as much sociological as biological, the more powerful because it
is situated far beneath the level of consciousness.
All Peter wants is to warm himself with the others but, deprived of
his being with by the collapse of his universe, he cannot warm himself
without wanting obscurely the being that is shining there, in this fire,
and the being that is indicated silently by all the eyes staring at him, by
all the hands stretched toward the fire.
A fire in the night is much more than a source of heat and light. As
soon as it is lit, people arrange themselves in a circle around it; they are

PETER'S DENIAL

151

n o longer a mere crowd, each one alone with himself, they have become
a community. Hands and faces are turned toward the fire and in turn are
lit by it; it is like a god's benevolent response to a prayer addressed to
him. Because everyone is facing the fire, they cannot avoid seeing each
other; they can exchange looks and words; a place for communion and
communication is established. Because of the fire vague new ways of

being with become possible. For Peter, the being with is re-created but in
a different place and with different partners.
Mark, Luke, and John mention this fire a second time, at the moment
when, in Mark and Luke, the servant girl appears for the first time. The
impression is that it is Peter's presence around the fire rather than in the
courtyard that provokes her interference. "She saw Peter warming himself

there, stared at him and said, 'You too were with Jesus, the man from
Nazareth:" Peter perhaps had pushed his way to the front, and there he
was right by the fire, in full light, where everyone could see him. Peter,
as always, has gone too far too fast. The fire enabled the servant girl to
recognize him in the dark, but that is not its chief role. The servant does
not fully understand what scandalizes her in Peter's attitude and forces
her to speak to him so insolently, but the fire, in Mark, is certainly there
for a purpose. The companion of the Nazarene is behaving as ifhe were
among his own, as if he belonged around this fire. Without the fire the
servant girl would not have been so indignant with Peter. The fire is
much more than an ordinary background. The being with cannot be­
come universal without losing its own value. That is why it is based on
exclusions. The servant speaks only of the being with Jesus, but there is
a second being with around the fire; this is what interests the servant girl,
b ecause it is hers; she knows how to defend its integrity; that is why she
refuses Peter the right to warm himself by the fire.
John makes the servant girl the porter, the guardian of the entrance.
She is the one who allows Peter to enter the courtyard on the recommen­
dation of the other disciple. The servant girl in fact plays the role of
guardian. The idea in itself is excellent, but it forces the evangelist to
maintain that Peter is recognized straight off, before he even approaches
the fire. So it is no longer by the light of this fire that the servant recog­
nizes the intruder; it is no longer the intimate and ritual character of the
scene that rouses her indignation. Moreover, in John, Peter is ques­
t ioned a third time not by the whole band of servants but by an individ­
ual who is presented as a· relative of the man whose ear Peter cut off (in
a useless effort to defend Jesus by violence, at the time of arrest). John

152

prefers the traditional interpretation that recognizes only one motive in
Peter's denial: fear. Although fear, of course, should not be entirely ex­
cluded, it should not be considered to play a decisive role, and careful
study of the four versions- not even John's - does not support such an
interpretation, despite first appearances. IfPeter were truly afraid for his
life, as most commentators suggest, he would never have gone into the
courtyard, especially ifhe had already been recognized. He would have
felt threatened and left immediately.
On the summons of the servant girl the circle loses its fraternal
character. Peter wants to hide himself from sight but the crowd presses
around him. He stays too close to the center, and the servant can follow
him easily with her eyes as he retreats to the entranL-eway. Once there,
he hestitates and waits for the sequence of events. His conduct is not
that of a man who is afraid. Peter moves away from the light and the heat
because he senses obscurely what the servant is trying to do, but he does
not leave. That is why she can repeat her accusation. She is trying not
to terrorize Peter but to embarrass him and to make him go away.
Seeing that Peter is not about to leave, the servant becomes involved
and repeats her news a second time. She announces that Peter belongs
to the group of disciples: "This man is one of them." The first time she
said it directly to Peter, but she intended it for the people around him,
those who were warming themselves at the fire, members of the commu­
nity threatened by the invasion of a stranger. She wanted to mobilize
them against the intrusion. The second time she speaks directly to
them, and achieves the result she wants; the whole group turns on Peter:

" \'Ou are one of them for surer' Your being with is not here, it is with the
Nazarene. In the exchange that follows it is Peter who raises his voice
and begins "calling down curses on himself and swearing?' Ifhe were afraid
for his life, or even for his freedom, he would have spoken less forcefully.
The superiority of Mark's text lies in the fact that he makes the same
servant girl speak twice running, instead of putting the words in the
mouths of others. His servant girl is more prominent. She shows initia­
tive and stirs up the group. We would say today that she shows leader­
ship qualities. But we should always be wary of psychologizing; it is not
the servant's personality that interests Mark but rather the way in which
she unleashes the group mechanism, the way she brings collective
mimeticism into play.

As I pointed out, the first time she is trying to stir up a group made
sluggish by the late hour and the heat of the fire. She wants them to fOl-

PETER'S DENIAL

low her example, and when they do not, she is the first to follow it. Her
lesson has no effect, so she repeats it a second time. Leaders know that
they must treat those who follow them like children; they must always
inspire imitation. The second example reinforces the effect of the first,
and this time it works. All the bystanders repeat together: " You are one
of them for sure! Why, you are a Galilean�'
The mimeticism is not characteristic only of Mark; the denial scene
is completely mimetic in all four Gospels, but in Mark the mechanism
for releasing the mimeticism is more clearly defined, from the begin­
ning, in the role of the fire and in that of the servant girl. Only Mark
makes the servant repeat herself twice in order to prime the mimetic
mechanism. She sets herself up as a model and, to make that model
more effective, she is the first to imitate it; she emphasizes her own role
of model and details mimetically what she expects from her companions.
The students repeat what their mistress tells them. The very words
of the servant are repeated but with something extra which reveals won­
derfully what is at work in the denial scene: for you are a Galilean. Illu­
minated in the first place by the fire, then revealed by his face, Peter is
finally identified by his accent. Matthew, as he does so often, puts on the
finishing touches by making Peter's persecutors say: ''your accent gives
you away." All those who are legitimately warming themselves around
the fire are from Jerusalem. That is where they are from. Peter has only
spoken twice, and each time only a few words, but it is enough for his
listeners to know without a doubt that he is a stranger, a scorned provin­
cial, a Galilean. The person with the accent, any accent, is always the
person who is not from here. Language is the surest indicator ofthe being
with. This is why Heidegger and his colleagues attach such importance
to the linguistic dimension of being. The specificity of national or even
regional language is fundamental. Everywhere it is said that the essen­
tial, in a text or even in a language, that which gives it its value, is un­
translatable. The Gospels are seen as inessential because they are
written in a cosmopolitan, debased Greek that is deprived of literary
prestige. Moreover, they are perfectly translatable, and it is easy to forget
what language one is reading them in provided one knows it, whether
it is the original Greek, vulgar Latin, French, German, English, or
Spanish. When one knows the Gospels, translating them into an un­
known language is .an excellent way of penetrating the intimacy of that
language with as little loss as possible. The Gospels are all things to all
people; they have no accent because they are all accents.

1 54

Peter is a n adult, and he cannot change the way he speaks. H e i s un­
able to imitate precisely the accent of the capital. Possession of the
desired being with is not just saying the same things as everyone else but
saying them the same way. The slightest nuance ofintonation can betray
one. Language is a treacherous servant- or a too faithful one- that al­
ways reveals the true identity one tries to conceal.
A mimetic rivalry is unleashed between Peter and his interlocutors
and at stake is the being with that dances in the flames. Peter tries desper­
ately to "integrate himself," to prove the excellence of his imitation, but
his antagonists tum unhesitatingly toward those aspects of cultural
mimeticism that cannot be imitated, such as language buried in the un­
conscious regions of the psyche.
The more deeply rooted, "authentic;' and ineradicable is the be­
longing, the more it is based on idioms that seem profound but are per­
haps insignificant, idiocies in both the French and the Greek sense of
idion, meaning "one's own:• The more something becomes our own, the
more in fact we belong to it; which does not mean that it is particularly
"inexhaustible:• In addition to language there is sexuality. John indicates
that the servant girl is young, and this may be a significant detail.
We are all possessed oflanguage and sex. Of course, but why always
mention it in the tone of the possessed. Maybe we can do better. Peter
understands clearly that he cannot deceive the world, and when he de­
nies his master so fiercely, it is not to convince anyone but to sever the
bonds that unite him to Jesus and to form others with those around him:
"But he started calling down curses on himselfand swearing, 'I do not know
the man you speak of. "
This is a truly religious bond-religare, to bind- and therefore Peter
has recourse to curses -like Herod in his exorbitant offer to Salome. His
violence and angry gestures are aimed not at Peter's interlocutors but at
Jesus himself. Peter makes Jesus his victim in order to stop being the sort
oflesser victim that first the servant girl and then the whole group make
him. What the crowd does to Peter he would like in turn to do to them
but cannot. He is not strong enough to triumph through vengeance. So
he tries to conciliate his enemies by allying himself with them against
Jesus, by treating Jesus as they want and in front of them, exactly as they
themselves treat him. In the eyes of these loyal servants Jesus must be
a good-for-nothing since he has been arrested and questioned brutally.
The best way to make friends in a hostile world is to espouse the enmi·
ties and adopt the others' enemies. What is said to these others, on such

PETER'S DENIAL

155

occasion, varies very little: "We are all ofthe same clan, we form one and
the same group inasmuch as we have the same scapegoat?'
No doubt there is fear at the origin of the denial, but there is also
shame. Like Peter's arrogance somewhat earlier, shame is a mimetic sen­
timent, in fact the most mimetic of sentiments. To experience it I must
look at myselfthrough the eyes of whoever makes me feel ashamed. This
requires intense imagination, which is the same as servile imitation. Im­
agine and imitate are in fact one and the same term. Peter is ashamed of
this Jesus whom all the world despises, ashamed of the model he chose,
and therefore ashamed of himself.
His desire to be accepted is intensified by the obstacles in the way.
Peter is therefore ready to pay very dearly for the admission denied him
by the servant and her friends, but the intensity of his desire is com­
pletely local and temporary, roused by the excitement of the game. This
is one ofthose small acts ofcowardice that everyone commits and no one
remembers. We should not be surprised at Peter's petty betrayal of his
master; we all do the same thing. What is astonishing is that the sacri­
ficial structure of persecution remains intact in the denial scene and is
transcribed as a whole just as accurately as in the murder ofJohn the
Baptist or in the Passion story.
Certain words of Matthew must be interpreted in the light of this
structural identity; their legal significance is merely their appearance.
What Jesus is really saying to people is the structural equivalent of all
persecution behavior:
''You havelearned how it was said to our ancestors: }ou must not kill; and if any­
one does kill he must answer for i t before the court. But I say this to you: anyone
who is angry with his brother will answer for it before the court; if a man calls
his brother 'Fool' he will answer for it before the Sanhedrin; and if a man calls
him 'Renegade' he will answer for it in hell fire?' (Matt. 5 : 2 1 -22)

The best way not to be crucified, in the final analysis, is to do as
everyone else and join in the crucifixion. The denial therefore is one epi­
sode of the Passion, a kind of eddy, a briefswirl in the vast current of
mimeticism of the victim that carries everyone toward Golgotha.
The formidable power of the text is confirmed immediately in that
its true significance cannot be ignored without repercussion, without
reproducing the structure of denial itself. More often than not this ends
in a "psychology of the prince of the Apostles?' Determining someone's
psychology is always to a certain degree a trial. Peter's ends in acquittal

} 56

diluted with blame. Peter is not completely at fault, nor is h e completely
absolved. He cannot be counted on. He is changeable, impulsive, some­
what weak in character. In other words he is like Pilate, and Pilate is
somewhat like Herod, who resembles anyone at all. Nothing is more
monotonous or simplistic in the last analysis than this mimetic psychol­
ogy of the Gospels. It may not be a psychology at all. From a distance
it takes on the infinite variety of the world that is so amusing, engaging,
and enriching. Close up, the same elements can be recognized in our
own lives and are, to tell the truth, scarcely amusing.
Around the fire the usual religion, which is inevitably mixed with
sacrifices, surfaces, in defense oflanguage and the lares, the purity of the
familial cult. Peter is naturally attracted by all this, just as we presuma­
bly are, since we reproach the biblical god for depriving us of it. Out of
wickedness, we say. It takes real wickedness to reveal the dimension of
persecution in this immemorial religion which still holds us under its
sway by indescribable bonds. The Gospel is not gentle with persecu­
tors, who are ashamed like ourselves. It unearths even in our most ordi­
nary behavior today, around the fire, the ancient gesture of the Aztec
sacrificers and witch-hunters as they forced their victims into the flames.
Like all deserters, Peter demonstrates the sincerity of his conversion
by blaming his old friends. We understand the moral implications of the
denial, we must also understand the anthropological dimension. With
his oaths and curses, Peter is inviting those who surround him to furm
a conjuration. Any group of men bound by oath forms the conjuration,
but the term is applied most readily when the group unanimously
adopts as their goal the death or loss of a prominent person. The word
is equally applied to rites of demonic expulsion and to magical practices
intended to counter magic.
The experience of innumerable rites of initiation consists of an act
of violence, putting an animal to death, or sometimes even a man recog­
nized as the adversary of the whole group. To achieve that belonging the
initiate must transform the adversary into a victim. Peter resorts to oaths
or religious fOrmulas to endow his denial with its initiatory force among
his persecutors.
If we are to interpret the denial accurately, we must take into ac·
count all that has gone befOre in the synoptics, especially in the two
scenes in which it is directly prepared and indicated. These are the two
chief announcements of the Passion by Jesus himself. The first time, Pe·

PETER'S DENIAL

157

ter does not want to understand: "Heaven preserve you, Lord, this must
not happen to you:' His reaction is the same as that of all the disciples.
Inevitable at the beginning the ideology of success dominates this little
world. They argue over the best places in the Kingdom of God. They
are mobilized for the good cause. The whole community is in the grasp
of mimetic desire and so is blind to the true nature of the revelation.
Jesus is seen above all as the miracle worker, the great leader, the politi­
cal chief.
The faith of the disciples is clothed in triumphant messianism. It is
nonetheless real for all this. Peter has shown us this, but a part of him
is still weighing the adventure he is about to experience in terms of
worldly success. What is the sense of a commitment that only ends in
failure, suffering, or death?
On this occasion Peter is severely reprimanded: "Get behind me,
Satan! You are an obstacle in my path"; [Jt1u scandalize me] (Man . 1 6 :23).
When it is proved to Peter that he is wrong, he immediately changes
direction and begins to run in the opposite direction at the same speed
as before. At the second announcement of the Passion, only a few hours
before the arrest, Peter does not react in the least as he did the first time.
" l-Ou will all losefaith in me this night"[be scandalized]. Jesus said to them:
At this, Peter said, "Though all lose faith in you, I will never lose faith?' Jesus
answered him, "I tell you solemnly, this very night before the cock crows, you
will have disowned me three times?' Peter said to him, "Even ifl have to die with
you, I will never disown you?' And all the disciples said the same. (Matt.
26:33-36)

Peter's apparent conviction becomes one with the intensity of his
mimeticism. The "argument" has been reversed since the first an­
nouncement, but the basis has not changed. It is the same with all the
disciples, who always repeat what Peter says, since they are as mimetic
as he. They imitate Jesus through the intermediary of Peter.
Jesus perceives that this zeal is heavy with the desertion that will
follow. He understands that his worldly prestige will collapse with his
arrest and he will no longer be the sort of model for his disciples that he
has been until now. Every mimetic incitement comes from an individual
or group that is hostile to his person or his message. The disciples, and
particularly Peter, are too easily influenced not to be influenced yet
again. The text of the Gospel has shown this in the passages I have dis-

158

T H E SCAPEG OAT

cussed. The fact that the model i s Jesus himself i s unimportant s o long
as it is imitated out of a conquering greed which is always basically iden­
tical with the alienation of desire.
Peter's first about-face, admittedly, is not in itself blameworthy, but
it is not exempt from mimetic desire, and Jesus clearly sees this. He sees
in it the promise of another about-face, which can only take the form of
a denial, given the catastrophe that is about to occur. Thus the denial
can be rationally predicted. In foreseeing it as he does, Jesus is only out·
lining for the immediate future the consequences of what he has ob­
served. Jesus, in other words, makes the same analysis as we do: he
compares Peter's successive reactions to the announcement of the Pas­
sion in order to deduce his probable betrayal. The proof of this is that
the prophesy of his denial is a direct answer to the second mimetic exhi­
bition of Peter's, and the reader draws on the same details as Jesus does
to form his opinion. If we understand mimetic desire we cannot fail to
draw the same conclusions. We are therefore led to believe that the
character called Jesus understands this desire in the sense that we under­
stand it This understanding reveals the rationality of the link between
the elements of the sequence formed by the two announcements of the
Passion, the prophesy of the denial, and the denial itself.
From Jesus' perspective mimetic desire is unquestionably involved,
since he resorts to the term that designates this desire, scandal, every
time he describes Peter's reactions, including the denial: You will all
scandalize yourselves because of me this night. And you will be scandalized
all the more surely because you are already victims of scandal. Your cer­
tainty that you are not, your illusion of invulnerability, says much of
your real condition and the future that is building. The myth ofindivid·
ual difference that Peter is defending here when he says I myself is itself
mimetic. Peter feels he is the most authentic of all the disciples, the most
capable of being the true emulator of Jesus, the only one really to pos·
sess the ontological model.
By rivaling each other in their theatrical show of affection the evil
sisters in King Lear persuade their father that they love him passion·
ately. The poor man imagines their rivalry is fed by genuine affection,
when the reverse is true. Pure rivalry produces a phantom affection. Je·
sus is never cynical, nor is he ever taken in by this kind of illusion. With·
out confusing Peter with one of the twins from Lear, we should
nevertheless recognize in him the puppet of a similar desire, which, be·
cause he is unaware of it, possesses him. He perceives the truth only

P E TER'S DEN IA L

1 59

later, after the denial, when he weeps bitterly at the thought of his mas­
ter and the prophesy.
In the great scene where Peter and the disciples display a false eager­
ness for the Passion, the Gospels suggest a satire of a certain religious
fervor which must be recognized as specifically "Christian:' The disci­
ples invent a new religious language, the language of the Passion. They
renounce the ideology of happiness and success but create a very similar
ideology of suffering and failure, a new social and mimetic mechanism
that functions exactly like the former exultation.
All the forms of adherence that men in groups can give to an enter­
prise are declared unworthy of Jesus. These attitudes are seen over and
over again during the course of the history of Christianity, especially in
our day. The new manners of the disciples are reminiscent ofthe trium­
phant anti-exultation of certain current Christian movements, their
very clerical anticlericalism. The fact that these sorts of attitudes are
stigmatized in the Gospels indicates that Christian inspiration at its
greatest has no connection with its psychological and sociological
by-products.
THEONE MIRACLE in the message of the denial is the same as the science

of desire seen in the words of Jesus. Because that science was not fully
understood in the Gospels, it took the form of a miracle in the narrow
sense. "this very night, before the cock crows, you will have disowned
me three times. Such miraculous precision in the prophetic announce­
ment eclipses the higher rationality revealed by textual analysis. There
are, however, too many details that contribute to that rationality to ig­
nore it. The convergence of the content of the narratives with the theory
of skanda/on- the theory of mimetic desire- cannot be fortuitous. We
are forced therefore to question whether the authors of the Gospels fully
understood the scope of this desire which is revealed in their texts.
The extraordinary importance given to the cock, first by the
Gospels and later by the whole of posterity, suggests a lack of total com­
prehension. This relative lack ofunderstanding transforms the cock into
a sort of animal fetish around which a certain "miracle" is crystallized.
In the Jerusalem of that time, we are told, the first and second cock­
crows indicated simply certain hours of the night. Thus originally the
reference to the cock may have had nothing to do with a real animal
crowing. In his Latin translation, Jerome makes this cock crow one more
time than in the original Greek. One of the two times the cock crows is

160

TH E SC A PEG 0 AT

not mentioned and, on his own initiative, the translator corrects what
seems to him to be an inadmissible, scandalous omission. The other
three evangelists probably felt that Mark had given too much impor·
tance to the cock. To put the cock in its place they make it crow only
once but do not dare omit it altogether. John finally mentions it, al·
though he leaves out any mention ofthe entire prophesy of the denial,
without which the cock has no reason for being.
There is no reason to treat a prediction that has a perfectly reason·
able explanation as miraculous unless, of course, one fails to perceive
the mimetic reasons for the denial and its antecedents in Peter's behav·
ior. Why would an author make into a miracle a prediction that can be
rationally explained? The most likely explanation is that he probably
did not understand that rationality, or understand it fully. This is what
I think happened in the story of the denial. The writer perceived but
could not identify a continuity underlying the apparent discontinuities
in Peter's conduct. He saw the importance of the concept of scandal but
could not master its application and was satisfied with repeating word
for word what he understood from Jesus himself or the primary inter·
mediary. The writer also did not understand the role of the cock, which
was less serious. But the two examples of incomprehension combine
naturally in the one outcome of the miracle of the cock. Both instances
correspond so well in their lack of clarity that, ultimately, each seems to
explain the other in a supernatural fashion. The tangible yet inexplica·
ble cock polarizes the diffuse, unaccountable quality of the whole scene.
Men tend to see a miracle in everything they don't understand. One ap­
parently mysterious but concrete detail is enough to bring about a
mythological crystallization. Thus the cock becomes a kind of fetish.
Inevitably, my analysis is speculative. But there are indications in
the Gospels that encourage such speculation. Jesus is critical of the dis·
ciples' excessive taste for miracles and of their inability to understand
the teaching imparted to them. These are the two weaknesses or, rather,
two faces of the one weakness that must be identified if we are to under·
stand the inclusion of a kind of miracle in a scene that has no need of
one. The superfluous presence of the miracle detracts from the denial
scene because it pushes into the background that wonderful comprehen·
sion of human behavior to be found in the text. The miracle fosters in·
tellectual and even spiritual laziness among believers and nonbelievers
alike.
The text of the Gospels was developed in the environment of the

PETER'S DENIAL

161

early disciples. Even after the clarification o fthe Pentecostal experience,
the first and second generations of Christians were aware of their own
shortcomings, which had been pointed out by Jesus himself. The texts
do not emphasize the unintelligibility of the revt:lation, even for the
most alert, in order to humiliate the first disciples or diminish them in
any way in the eyes of posterity. They do so in order to suggest the dis­
tance separating Jesus and his spirit from those who were the first to re­
ceive his message and transmit it to us. We cannot afford to ignore this
indication when we interpret the Gospels, some two thousand years
later, in a world that has no more natural intelligence than in the time
of]esus but is nonetheless capable for the first time of hearing certain
aspects of his doctrine because they have slowly penetrated over the
course of centuries. These are obviously not the aspects that occur to us
when we think of"Christianity" or even "the Gospels;' but they are ex­
tremely necessary if we are to have a better understanding of such texts
as the denial scene.
If l am right and the evangelists did not understand clearly the ra­
tionality of the denial and the prophesy Jesus made, then our text is
astonishing in that it relates simultaneously both the miracle imposed
on the scene by writers who did not understand its logic and the details
that permit us today to trace that logic. The Gospels put into our hands
all the parts of a document they are not quite capable of interpreting
since they substitute an irrational interpretation for the rational one we
extract from the same details. I am forever aware that we can say nothing
about Jesus that does not come from the Gospels.
Our text adds a miraculous explanation to a scene that is better un­
derstood without the aid of this miracle. The writers of the Gospels,
therefore, despite their inability to understand, must have put together
and transcribed the pieces of the document with a remarkable accuracy.
If I am right, their inadequacy on certain particular points is compen­
sated for by an extraordinary fidelity on all other points.
At first sight, this combination of qualities and defects seems hard
to reconcile, but a moment's reflection is enough to convince us that it
is not only likely but also probable, for the very reason that the writing
of the Gospels was influenced by the very same mimeticism that was the
subject of Jesus' endless reproaches to his disciples, the same mimeti­
cism that we see in their behavior. It is normal that with the best will
in the world they did not fully understand its function since they had
not yet freed themselves from it.

162

T H E SCAPEG OAT

I f my reading is accurate, the mythical crystallization around the
cock derives from a phenomenon of mimetic exacerbation similar to the
examples given us in the Gospels. In the murder of]ohn the Baptist, for
example, the motif of the head on the platter results from a too-literal im­
itation. For absolute fidelity, the passage from one individual to another,
or the translation from one language to another, demands a certain dis­
tance. The transcriber who is too absorbed in his model and therefore
too close to him reproduces all the details with an admirable accuracy
but is subject to occasional lapses that are truly mythological. The
powerful mimetic attention or extreme concentration on the victim­
model results in the primitive custom of making the victim sacred, the
scapegoat whose innocence is not recognized becomes divine.
The strengths and weaknesses of the Gospel witness can be found
in a particularly precise and clear form in the treatment of the concept
that is crucial for the mimetic reading: scandal. The most interesting
uses of skanda/on and scanda/idzein are all attributed to Jesus himself,
and they appear as fragments gathered in a somewhat arbitrary fashion.
Important sentences do not always follow in a logical sequence, and
their order is frequently different from one Gospel to another. Scholars
have shown that this order can be determined by the presence in a
phrase of a single word which is then followed by another sentence, only
because the same word appears in it. This gives an impression of sen­
tences learned by heart and joined together by mnemonic means.
In order to understand the value of scandal in explaining, therefore,
all these sentences must be reorganized. They must be treated like pieces
of a puzzle which is the mimetic theory itself, once the correct arrange­
ment has been found. This is what I tried to show in Des choses
cachies . . .
We are therefore dealing with an extraordinarily coherent unity that
was never perceived by the exegetes because its components are mud­
dled, and sometimes a little deformed, due to the authors' lack of con­
trol. When left to themselves these authors tell us vaguely that Jesus
knows what is in man, but they explain this knowledge poorly. They
have all the details in their hands, but these are disorganized and con­
taminated with miracles because the authors have only partial control
over them.
There is an irreducible supernatural dimension to the Gospels that
I do not wish to deny or denigrate. But because of this we should not re­
fuse the means of comprehension now available to us which can only

PETER'S DENIAL

163

decrease the role of the miraculous if they are truly means of compre­
hension. The miraculous by definition is the unintelligible; it is not
therefore the true work of the spirit according to the Gospel meaning.
There is a greater miracle than the narrowly defined miracle and that is
something becoming intelligible that was not so- mythological obscu­
rity becoming transparent.
Confronted with the text ofthe Gospels, proponents and opponents
alike only want to see the miracle and unequivocally condemn even the
most legitimate effort to show that its role may be exaggerated. But
rational suspicion is in no way contrary to the Gospels which themselves
warn us against abuse of the miraculous. The rationality I am disclos­
ing, the mimeticism of human relations, is too systematic in principle,
too complex in its effects, and too visibly present, both in the "theoreti­
cal" passages on scandal and in the accounts entirely controlled by it, to
be there by accident. Nevertheless this rationality was not completely
devised or created by those who put it there. If they had understood it
fully they would not have interposed between their readers and the
scenes we have just read the coarse presence of the miraculous cock.
Under these circumstances the Gospels cannot be the product of a
work that was purely within the effervescent milieu of the early Chris­
tians. At the text's origin there must have been someone outside the
group, a higher intelligence that controlled the disciples and inspired
their writings. As we succeed in reconstituting the mimetic theory in a
kind of coming and going between the narratives and the theoretical
passages, the words attributed to Jesus, we are disclosing the traces of
that intelligence, not the reflections of the disciples.
The Gospel writers are the necessary intermediaries between our­
selves and him whom they call Jesus. But in the example of Peter's
denial, and in all of its antecedents, their insufficiency becomes a posi­
tive quality. It increases the credibility and power of the witness. The
fuilure of the Gospel writers to understand certain things, together with
their extreme accuracy in most cases, makes them somewhat passive in­
termediaries. Through their relative lack of comprehension we cannot
help but think that we can attain directly a level of comprehension
greater than theirs. We have the impression therefore of a communica­
tion without intermediaries. We gain this privilege not through an in­
trinsically superior intelligence but as the result of two thousand years
of a history slowly fashioned by the Gospels themselves.
There is no need for this history to unfold according to the princi-

164

THE SCAPEGOAT

pies of conduct articulated by Jesus; it need not become a utopia before
making accessible to us aspects of the Gospel text that were not accessi­
ble to the first disciples. It is sufficient that there has been a gradual but
continual growth of awareness of the representation of persecutions by
persecutors which continues to grow without, unfortunately, preventing
us from engaging in persecution ourselves.
In those passages that suddenly become clear, the Gospel text is
somewhat like a password communicated by go-betweens who are not
included in the secret. Those of us who receive the password are all the
more grateful because the messenger's ignorance guarantees the authen­
ticity ofthe message. We have the joyous certainty that nothing essential
can have been falsified. My image is not a good one, however, for ifa sign
is to become a password it is sufficient to modify its sense by a conven­
tional decision, whereas here there is a whole collection of signs, for­
merly inert and colorless, that suddenly catch fire and shine with
intelligence, without any preliminary convention. A festival of light is
lit around us to celebrate the resurrection of a meaning that we did not
even know was dead

C H A P T E R T H I RT E E N

The Demons of Gerasa
ThE GOSPELS REVEAL all kinds of human relationships that at first seem
incomprehensible and fundamentally irrational. These can and must ul­
timately be reduced to a single unifying factor: mimeticism. Mimeti­
cism is the original source of all man's troubles, desires, and rivalries, his
tragic and grotesque misunderstandings, the source of all disorder and
therefore equally of all order through the mediation of scapegoats.
These victims are the spontaneous agents of reconciliation, since, in the
final paroxysm of mimeticism, they unite in opposition to themselves
those who were organized in opposition to each other by the effects of
a previous weaker mimeticism.
These are the underlying dynamics of all mythological and reli­
gious beginnings, dynamics that other religions succeed in concealing
from themselves and from us by suppressing or disguising collective
murders and minimizing or eliminating the stereotypes of persecution
in a hundred different ways. The Gospels, on the other hand, expose
these same dynamics with an unequaled severity and strength.
Peter's denial, the murder of John the Baptist, and, above all, the
Passion itself, the true heart and center of this revelation, delineate the
lines of force with an almost didactic insistence. It is a question of forc­
ing people who from time immemorial have been imprisoned by mytho­
logical representations of persecution to accept certain decisive truths
that would prevent them from making their own victims sacred and
thereby free them.
,
Each of the Gospel stories reveals a religious origin that must re­
main hidden if mythology and ritual are to be the result. This origin is
based on the unanimous belief in the victim's guilt, a belief that the

166

T H E SCAPEG OAT

Gospels destroy forever. There is n o common ground between what
happens in the Gospels and what happens in myths, particularly the
more developed myths. Later religions diminish, minimize, soften, and
even totally eliminate sacred guilt as well as any trace of violence; but
these are minor dissimulations and bear no relation to the system of
representing persecution. This system collapses in the world of the
Gospels. There is no longer any question of softening or sublimation.
Rather, a return to truth is made possible by a process which, in our lack
of understanding, we consider primitive simply because it reproduces
the violent origin once more, this time in order to reveal it and thus
make it inoperative.
The texts we have just read are all examples of this process. They
correspond perfectly to the way in which Jesus himself, and after him
Paul in the Epistles, defines the effect of disintegration . that the
Crucifixion had on the forces of this world. The Passion reveals the
scapegoat mechanism, i.e., that which should remain invisible if these
forces are to maintain themselves. By revealing that mechanism and the
surrounding mimeticism, the Gospels set in motion the only textual
mechanism that can put an end to humanity's imprisonment in the sys­
tem of mythological representation based on the false transcendence of
a victim who is made sacred because of the unanimous verdict of guilt.
This transcendence is mentioned directly in the Gospels and the
New Testament. It is even given many names, but the main one is Sat3}!J
who would not be considered simultaneously murderer from the begin­
ru"ng, father of lies, and prince of this world were he not identified with the
false transcendence of violence. Nor is it by chance that, of all Satan's
faults, envy and jealousy are the most in evidence. Satan could be said
to incar��te mimetfc desire were that desire not, by definition, disincar­
nate. It empties all people, all things, and all texts of their substance.
When the false transcendence is envisaged in its fundamental unity,
the Gospels call it the devil or Satan, but when it is envisaged in its mul­
tiplicity then the mention is always of demons or demonic forces. The
word demon can obviously be a synonym for Satan, but it is mostly ap­
plied to inferior forms of the "power of this world;' to the degraded
manifestations that we would call psychopathological. By the very fact
that transcendence appears in multiple and fragmented form, it loses its
strength and dissolves into pure mimetic disorder. Thus, unlike Satan,
who is seen as principle of both order and disorder, the demonic forces
are invoked at times when disorder predominates.

T H E D EM O N S O F G E R A S A

167

Since the Gospels give to these "forces" names that come from reli­
gious tradition and magic belief they would still appear to recognize
them as autonomous, spiritual entities, endowed with individual per­
sonality. On every page of the Gospels we see demons speaking, ques­
tioning Jesus, begging him to leave them in peace. In the great
temptation-in-the-desert scene Satan appears in person to seduce the Son
of God with false promises and divert him from his mission.
Far from destroying magic superstitions and vulgar forms of reli­
gious beliefs the Gospels seem to reintroduce this type of belief in a par­
ticularly pernicious form. The witch-hunters of the late Middle Ages,
after all, based the justification for their activities on the demonology
and satanism of the Gospels. For many people, especially today, the
swarms of demons "obscure the luminous aspect ofthe Gospels;' and Je­
sus' miraculous cures are hard to distinguish from the traditional exor­
cisms of primitive societies. None of the miracles appears in my
commentaries so far. Some critics have remarked on this and suggested,
naturally, that I am avoiding an encounter that would not support my
thesis; by choosing my texts with extreme care in order to avoid all the
others, I confer a false probability on perspectives that are too contrary
to good sense to be taken seriously.
In order to provide as conclusive a proof as possible I will once more
refer to Mark. Of the four evangelists Mark is most fond of miracles, de­
votes the most time to them, and presents them in the fashion that is most
contrary to modern sensibility. Perhaps the most spectacular of all the
miraculous cures to be found in Mark is the episode of the demons_pj
!}e_!�sa. The text is long enough and contains enough concrete details to
provide commentators with a grasp that is lacking in the shorter episodes.
Gerasa is one of those texts that is always alluded to with terms such
as "wild;' "primitive;' "backward;' "superstitious;• and all the typical ad­
jectives which positivists apply to religion in general, no matter what
the origin, but which, because they are considered too pejorative for the
non-Christian religions, will in the future be reserved for Christianity.
My analysis will focus on Mark, but I will refer to Luke and Matthew
each time their version provides interesting variants. After crossing the
sea of Galilee, Jesus lands on the west bank, in heathen territory, in the
country of Decapolis:
And no sooner had he left the boat than a man with an unclean spirit came out
from the tombs toward him. The man lived in the tombs and no one could se­
cure him any more, even with a chain; because he had often been secured with

168

T H E SCAPEGOAT

fetters and chains but had snapped the chains and broken the fetters, and no one
had the strength to control him. All night and all day, among the tombs and in
the mountains, he would howl and gash himself with stones. Catching sight of
Jesus from a distance, he ran up and fell at his feet and shouted at the top of his
voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, son of the Most High God? Swear by
God you will not torture me!'!.. For Jesus had been saying to him, "Come out of
the man, unclean spirit:' "What is your name?" Jesus asked. "My name is le·
gion;' he answered, "for there are many ofus:' And he begged him earnestly not
to send them out of the district. Now there was there on the mountainside a
great herd of pigs feeding, and the unclean spirits begged him, "Send us to the
pigs, let us go into them:' So he gave them leave. With that, the unclean spirits
came out and went into the pigs, and the herd of about two thousand pigs
charged down the cliff into the lake, and there they were drowned. The swine·
herds ran off and told their story in the town and in the country around about;
and the people came to see what had really happened. They came to Jesus and
saw the demoniac sitting there, clothed and in his full senses-the very man
who had had the legion in him before - and they were afraid. And those who had
witnessed it reported what had happened to the demoniac and what had become
of the pigs. Then they began to implore Jesus to leave the neighborhood. (Mark
5 : 1 - 1 7)

The possessed lived among the tombs. This fact impressed Mark,
and he repeats it three times. The wretched man, night and day, was al­
ways among the tombs. He comes out of the tombs to meet Jesus. He is
freer than any other man since he has broken all the chains, despised all
rules, and even, according to Luke, wears no clothes, yet he is possessed,
a prisoner ofhis own madness. This man is a living corpse. His state can
be recognized as one of the phenomena of the mimetic crisis that leads
to the loss of differentiation and to persecution. There is no longer any
difference between life and death, freedom and captivity. Yet existence
in the tombs, far from human habitation, is not a permanent phenome­
non, the result of a single and definitive break between the possessed
and the community. Mark's text suggests that the Gerasenes and their
demoniac have been settled for some time in a sort ofcyclical pathology.
Luke gives it even greater emphasis when he presents the possessed as
a man from the wwn and tell us that a demon had driven him into the wilds
only during his bad spells. Demonic possession abolishes a difference
between life within and without the city, a difference that is not unim·
portant since it is mentioned again later in the text.
Luke's description implies intermittent spells, with periods of
remission, during which the sick man returns to the city. "It was a devil

T H E DEMONS 0 F GERASA

169

that had seized on him a great many times, and then they used to secure
him with chains and fetters to restrain him, but he would always break
the fastenings, and the devil would drive him out into the wilds" (Luke
8:29-30). The Gerasenes and their demoniac periodically repeat the
same crisis in more or less the same fashion. When the men of the city
suspect that another departure is at hand, they try to prevent it by bind­
ing their fellow citizen with chains and fetters. They do this to restrain
him, we are told. Why do they want to restrain him? The reason seems
quite clear. Curing a sick man requires removal of the symptoms of his
sickness. In this case the chief symptom is the wandering in the moun­
tains and the tombs. This is what the Gerasenes are trying to prevent
with their chains. The sickness is so terrible they have no hesitation in
resorting to violence. But clearly this is not the best method: each time
their victim overcomes every effort to hold him back. Recourse to vio­
lence only increases his desire for solitude and the strength of that de­
sire, so that the unfortunate man becomes truly indomitable. "And no
one had the strength to subdue him;' Mark tells us.
The repetitive character of these phenomena is somewhat ritualis­
tic. All the actors know exactly what is going to happen in each episode
and behave appropriately so that in fact everything happens as it did be­
fore. It is difficult to believe that the Gerasenes cannot find chains and
fetters strong enough to hold their prisoner. Perhaps they are ashamed
of their violence and do not exert the energy needed to make it effective.
Whatever the reason, they seem to behave like sick men whose every
action fosters rather than decreases the disease. All rituals tend to be
transformed into theatrical performances in which the actors play their
parts with all the more exuberance for having played them so many times
before. This does not mean that the participants do not experience real
suffering. The drama would not be as effective as it obviously is if there
were not moments of real suffering for the city and its surroundings, in
other words for the community. The Gerasenes are consternated at the
idea of their being deprived of the suffering. They must gain some en­
joyment from this drama and even feel the need of it since they beg Jesus
to leave immediately and stop interfering in their affairs. Their request
is paradoxical, given that Jesus had just succeeded, without any violence,
in obtaining the result which they had professed to be aiming at with
their chains and fetters but which, in reality, they did not want at all: the
complete cure of the possessed man. In this episode, as always.J�sus�
presence reveals the truth of the hidden desires. Simeon's prophesy is

170

THE SCAPEGOAT

once more confirmed. "You see this child: he is destined . . . to be a sign
that is rejected . . . so that the secret thoughts of many may be laid bare:'
But what is the meaning of this drama, what is its role on the sym­
bolic plane? The sick man runs among the tombs and on the mountains,
Mark tells us, always crying out and bruising himself with stones. In Jean
Starobinski's remarkable commentary on this text he gives a perfect
definition for this strange conduct : autolapidation.1 But why would
anyone want to stone himself? Why would one be obsessed with ston­
ing? When the possessed breaks his bonds and escapes from the commu­
nity he must expect to be pursued by those who tried to chain him Such
may actually be the case. He is fleeing from the stones that his pursuers
may be throwing at him. The unfortunate Job was followed and stoned
by the inhabitants of his village. Nothing similar is mentioned in the
story of Gerasa. Perhaps because he never does become the object of
stoning, the demoniac wounds himself with stones. In mythical fashion
he maintains the peril with which he believes himself to be threatened.
Has he been the object ofreal threats, has he survived an aborted at­
tempt at stoning like the adulterous woman in the Gospel of John, or is
it, in this case, a purely imaginary fear, a simple phantasm? If it is a
phantasm then I must ask the psychoanalyst whether the phantasm is
the same among societies that practice stoning as among those that do
not. Perhaps the possessed said to his fellow citizens: "Look, there's no
need to treat me the way you wish, there's no need to stone me; I will
carry out your sentence on myself. The punishment I will inflict on my­
self will be fur more horrible than any you would dream of inflicting on
me:'
Notice the mimetic character of this behavior. As ifhe is trying to
avoid being expelled and stoned in reality, the possessed brings about
his own expulsion and stoning; he provides a spectacular mime of all the
stages of punishment that Middle Eastern societies inflict on criminals
whom they consider completely defiled and irredeemable. First, the
man is hunted, then stoned, and finally he is killed; this is why the pos­
sessed lived among the tombs. The Gerasenes must have some under­
standing of why they are reproached or they would not respond as they
do. Their mitigated violence is an ineffective protest. Their answer is:
"No, we do not want to stone you because we want to keep you near us.

THE DEMONS OF GERASA

171

No ostracism hangs over you:' Unfortunately, like anyone who feels
wrongfully yet feasibly accused, the Gerasenes protest violently, they
protest their good faith with violence, thereby reinforcing the terror of
the possessed. Proof of their awareness of their own contradiction lies in
the fact that the chains are never strong enough to convince their victim
of their good intentions toward him.
The violence of the Gerasenes is hardly reassuring for the pos­
sessed. Reciprocally, the violence of the possessed disturbs the Gera­
senes. As always, each one tries to end violence with a violence that
should be definitive but instead perpetuates the circularity of the proc­
ess. A symmetry can be seen in all these extremes, the self-laceration and
the running among the tombs on the one hand, the grandiloquent
chains on the other. There is a sort of conspiracy between the victim and
his torturers to keep the balance in the game because it is obviously
necessary to keep the balance of the Gerasene community.
The possessed does violence to himself as a reproach to the Gera­
senes for their violence. The Gerasenes return his reproach with a vio­
lence that reinforces his own and somehow verifies the accusation and
counteraccusation that circulate endlessly within the system. The pos­
sessed imitates these Gerasenes who stone their victims, but the Gera­
senes in return imitate the possessed. A mirror relationship of doubles
links the persecutors who are persecuted and the persecuted who perse­
cutes. This is an example of the reciprocal relationship of mimetic
rivalry. It is not a relationship of the stoned with those who stone him,
but it is almost the same thing since, on the one hand, there is a violent
parody of stoning and, on the other, the no-less-violent denial. This is
a variant of violent expulsion that has the same aim as the other vari­
ants, including stoning.
Ifl am mistaken in my identification of mimetic doubles in the con­
text of the demons ofGerasa, the mistake is not mine alone. It is shared
in at least one of the Gospels, Matthew, when there is mention at the
end of the miracle of a significant variant. Matthew substitutes for the
single demoniac in Mark and Luke two identical possessed beings and
has them speak for themselves instead of the demon -two demons- who
are supposed to possess them. There is nothing to suggest a source
different from Mark's. Rather it is an attempt to explicate (I wanted to
say demystify) the demonic theme in general. In texts like the Gerasa
text Matthew is often different from Mark, either in his suppression of
a detail he considers worthless or in the explanatory twist he gives to the

172

THE SCAPEGOAT

themes h e retains, so that they are both the themes and his own explica­
tion. We saw one example in the murder of John the Baptist. Matthew
substitutes the expression "prompted by her mother" for the exchange of
questions and answers which, in Mark, suggests somewhat enigmati·
cally the mimetic transmission of desire between mother and daughter.
Matthew is doing much the same thing here but much more auda­
ciously. He wants to suggest what we ourselves have learned during our
readings. Possession is not an individual phenomenon; it is the result of
aggravated mimeticism. There are always at least two beings who pos·
sess each other reciprocally, each is the other's scandal, his model­
obstacle. Each is the other's demon; that is why in the first part of Mat·
thew's account the demons are not distinct from those they possess:
When he reached the country of the Gadarenes on the other side, two
demoniacs came toward him out of the tombs- creatures so fierce that no one
could pass that way. They stood there shouting, "What do you want with us,
Son of God? Have you come here to tonure us before the time?" (Man. 8:28)

The proof that Matthew considers the possession to be a function
ofthe mimeticism of doubles and ofthe stumbling block lies in the fact
that what he adds can be found neither in Mark's nor in Luke's text:
those that came to meet Jesus, he tells us, were "so fierce that no one
could pass that way:' In other words these are essentially people who bar
the way, like Peter with Jesus when he advised against the Passion.
These are people who are each other's and their neighbors' scandal.
Scandal is always contagious; those who are scandalized are likely to
communicate their desire to you, or, in other words, drag you along their
same path so that they become your model-obstacle and in turn scandal­
ize you. Every reference in the Gospels to the way that is barred, the in­
surmountable obstacle, the stone too heavy to be raised, is an allusion to
the whole concomitant system of scandal.
In order to explain possession through the mimeticism of scandal,
Matthew turns to the minimal mimetic relationship, to what might be
called its basic unit. He endeavors to return to the source of the evil.
This movement is not generally understood since it reverses the mytho·
logical practice oftoday's psychology and psychoanalysis. The latter in·
teriorize the double; they have need of an imaginary demon within
consciousness or the unconscious. Matthew exteriorizes the demon in a
real mimetic relationship between two real individuals.
Matthew improves the account of the miracle on this one major

T H E DEMONS OF G E RASA

173

point or, rather, he prepares an analysis ofit. He teaches us that duality
cannot help but be present at the very outset of mimetic play. What is
interesting is that, precisely because he introduces duality at the very
beginning of his account, this writer then finds himself in difficulty in
trying to introduce the multiplicity that is indispensable for the unfold­
ing of the miracle. He has to eliminate Mark's key sentence: "My name
is Legion; for there are many of us" which contributes so much to the
fame of the text with its strange transition from singular to plural. This
break is again found in the following sentence, which repeats indirectly
the sequel to the proposals the demon is supposed to have made to Jesus:
"and he begged him earnestly not to send them out of the district.
Nowhere in Matthew, or in Luke who is closer to Mark, do we find
the one essential detail that the demon is actually many although he
speaks as a single person, and, in a way, is only one person. By not in­
cluding the crowd of demons Matthew loses the justification for the
drowning of the herd of swine, yet he retains that action. In fact, he ulti­
mately loses more than he gains. He seems to be aware of his failure and
cuts the miracle short. Like all Mark's strokes of genius, such as
Salome's question to her mother: "What shall I ask?'� this juxtaposition
of singular and plural in the same sentence may seem like a clumsy in­
clusion that has been eliminated by Luke who is generally more skillful
and correct than Mark in his manipulation of the language. "'Legion; he
said- because many devils had gone into him. And these pleaded with
him not to order them to depart into the Abyss" (Luke 8:30-3 1).
In his commentary on Mark, Jean Starobinski clearly shows the
negative connotations of the word Legion. It indicates "the warlike mob,
the hostile troop, the occupying army, the Roman invader, and perhaps
even those who crucified Christ?'2 The critic rightly observes the im­
portant role played by the crowd not only in the history of the demoniac
but also in the immediately preceding and succeeding texts. The heal­
ing in itself is portrayed as a single combat between Jesus and the de­
mon, but before and after there is always a crowd around Jesus. First
there was the crowd of Galileans whom the disciples sent away in order
to get into the boat with Jesus. As soon as he returns the crowd is there
again. At Gerasa there is not only the crowd of demons and the crowd
of swine but there are also the Gerasenes who came running to him in
crowds from the city and the country. Quoting Kierkegaard, "the mob

D4

THE SCAPEGOAT

is the lie;' Starobinski notes that evil in the Gospels is always on the side
of plurality and the crowd.
There is, nevertheless, a remarkable difference between the behav­
ior of the Galileans and the behavior of the Gerasenes. Like the crowds
in Jerusalem, the Galileans are not afraid of miracles. They could turn
against the thaumaturge in an instant, but for the moment they cling to
him as a savior. The sick gather from all quarters. In Jewish territory
everyone is greedy for miracles and signs, wanting either to benefit per·
sonally or to have others benefit, or quite simply to be a spectator and
participate in the unusual event as in a play that is more extraordinary
than enlightening.
The Gerasenes have a different reaction. When they see the
demoniac "sitting there, clothed and in his full senses, the very man
who had the legion in him before;' they are afraid. They have the herds­
men explain to them "what had happened to the demoniac and what had
become of the pigs:• Instead of calming their fears and arousing their
enthusiasm or at least their curiosity, the account increases their anxi­
ety. The inhabitants demand Jesus' departure. And Jesus gives them
that satisfaction without saying a word. The man he has cured wants to
follow him, but he urges him to remain with his own people. He em­
barks in silence to return to Jewish territory.
There has been no sermon or any real exchange, not even a hostile
one, with these people. We are given the impression that the entire local
population demands his departure and that these Gerasenes arrive in an
orderly fashion, unlike the flock without a shepherd that rouses Jesus'
pity. The community is differentiated, since the inhabitants from the
country can be distinguished from the inhabitants from the city. They
ask for information calmly and make a thoughtful decision, which they
then present to Jesus when they ask him to depart. They do not respond
to the miracle with either hysterical adulation or passionate hate, but
without hesitation they determine not to accept it They want nothing
to do with Jesus and what he represents.
The Gerasenes are not upset at the disappearance of their herd for
mercenary reasons. Clearly, the drowning of their pigs disturbs them
less than the drowning of their demons. If this is to be understood, it
must be recognized that the attachment of the Gerasenes to their de­
mons has its counterpart in the demons' attachment to the Gerasenes.
Legion was not too fearful provided he was permitted to remain in his
country. "And he begged him earnestly not to send them out of the dis·

T H E DEMONS OF GERASA

175

trict?' Since the demons cannot survive without a living habitation they
need to possess someone else, preferably a human being but, if not, then
an animal, in this case the herd of swine. The reasonable request shows
that the demons have no illusions. They ask as a favor the right to enter
these loathsome animals: so they are obviously in a difficult position.
They know they are dealing with someone powerful. They decide they
are more likely to be tolerated if they are content with less. It is essential
for them not to be completely and definitively expelled.
The reciprocal bond between the demons and the Gerasenes
reproduces on a different level the relationship between the possessed
and these same Gerasenes observed in our analysis. They cannot do
without him or he without them. This conjunction of both ritual and
cyclical pathology is not peculiar. As it degenerates ritual loses its preci­
sion. The expulsion is not permanent or absolute, and the scapegoat­
the possessed- returns to the city between crises. Everything blends,
nothing ever ends. The rite tends to relapse into its original state; the
relationships of mimetic doubles provoke the crisis of indifferentiation.
Physical violence gives way to the violence of psychopathological rela­
tionships that is not fatal but is never resolved or ended. The total lack
of differentiation is never reached. There remains enough difference be­
tween the voluntary exile and the Gerasenes who refuse to expel him,
enough real drama in each repetition to achieve a certain catharsis. A
total disintegration is in process but has not yet taken place. The Gera­
sene society is therefore still somewhat structured, more so than the
crowds from Galilee or Jerusalem. There are still differences within the
system, between city and country for example, and these are manifested
by the calmly negative reaction to Jesus' therapeutic success.
This society is not exactly in splendid shape; in fact it is quite disin­
tegrated but not quite desperate, and the Gerasenes are able to preserve
their fragile status quo. They still form a community in the accepted
sense. As far as we can tell this system is perpetuated, for better or
worse, by very degenerate sacrificial procedures that are nevertheless
precious and irreplaceable since they have apparently reached the limit.
All the commentators say that Jesus heals the possessed by the clas­
sical methods of the shamans. For example, in this passage, he makes
the impure spirit name himself, thereby acquiring over him the power
that is so often associated in primitive societies with the manipulation
of proper names. There is nothing very exceptional in this, and it is not
what the text is trying to suggest to us. If there were nothing extraordi-

176

T H E S C AP E G O AT

nary in what Jesus did, there would have been no reason for the Gera­
senes to be afraid. They certainly had their own healers who worked
with the same methods critics attribute to Jesus. If Jesus were just
another more successful medicine man, these good people would have
been delighted rather than afraid. They would have begged Jesus to stay
instead of going away.
Can the Gerasenes' fear be accounted for by rhetorical exaggeration?
Is it lacking in substance and intended merely to make the Messiah's
prowess more impressive? I do not think so. The destruction of the herd
of pigs possessed by the demons is described in the same way in all three
Gospels. "And the herd . . . charged down the cliff into the lake:' The
steep bank appears also in Matthew and Luke; therefore the pigs had to
have been on a kind of promontory. Mark and Luke are aware of this,
and to prepare the way for the cliff they place the animals on a mountain.
Matthew does not mention a mountain but he does retain the cliff­
which means it was the cliff that caught the attention of the evangelists.
It increased the height of the fall. The further the pigs fell, the more
striking the scene. But the Gospels are not concerned with the pic­
turesque, and it is not for the visual effect that they all speak of a cliff.
A functional reason could be urged. The distance covered in free fall be­
fore hitting the surface of the lake guaranteed the definitive disappear­
ance of the herd of pigs. There is no risk that they may escape, they will
not swim back to the bank. All this is true; the cliff is necessitated by the
realistic economy of the scene, but the Gospels were not particularly
concerned with the realism either. There is something else much more
essential.
Those who are used to reading mythological and religious texts will
or should recognize immediately this theme of the cliff. Just like ston­
ing, falling from a high cliff has collective, ritual, and penal connota­
tions. This was a widespread practice among both ancient and primitive
societies. It is a kind of sacrificial immolation that is distinct from the
later practice of beheading. Rome had its Tarpeian rock. In the Greek
universe the ritual Pharmakos was periodically put to death in the same
way, especially in Marseille. The unfortunate man was made to throw
himself into the sea from such a height that death was inevitable.
Two of the great ritualistic methods of execution figure explicitly in
our text: stoning and falling from a high cliff. There are resemblances.
All the members of the community can and should throw stones at the
victim. All the members of the community can and should advance on

T H E DEMONS OF G E R A SA

177

the condemned person together and force him to the edge of the cliff so
that there is no alternative but death. The resemblances are not limited
to the collective nature of the execution. Everyone participates in the
destruction of the anathema but no one enters into direct physical con­
tact with him. No one risks contamination. The group alone is responsi­
ble. Individuals share the same degree of innocence and responsibility.
It can be said that this is equally true of all other traditional forms of
execution, especially any form of exposure, of which crucifixion is one
variant. The superstitious fear of physical contact with the victim
should not blind us to the fact that these techniques of execution resolve
an essential problem for societies with weak or nonexistent judicial sys­
tems, societies still impregnated with the spirit ofprivate revenge so that
they were frequently exposed to the threat of endless violence at the
heart of the community.
These methods of execution do not feed the appetite for vengeance
since they eliminate any difference in individual roles. The persecutors
all behave in the same way. Anyone who dreams of vengeance must take
it from the whole collectivity. It is as if the power of the state, nonexist­
ent in this type of society, comes into temporary but nevertheless real
rather than symbolic existence in these violent forms of unanimity.
These collective modes of capital execution correspond so closely to
the defined need that at first it is difficult to imagine that they occur
spontaneously in human communities. So well adapted are they to their
purpose it seems impossible that they were not conceived prior to their
realization. This is always either the modern illusion of functionalism
that believes that need creates the means or the ancient illusion of reli­
gious traditions that always point to a kind ofprimordial legislator, a be­
ing ofsuperhuman wisdom and authority who endowed the community
with all its basic institutions.
In reality things happen differently. It is absurd to think that such
a problem is first posed in theory before it is resolved in practice. But as
long as one does not accept that the solution might precede the problem
or consider what type of solution might precede the problem, then the
absurdity cannot be avoided. Obviously, this is one of the spontaneous
effects of a scapegoat. In a crisis of mimetic conflict, the polarization on
a single victim can become so powerful that all members of the group
are forced to participate in his murder. This type of collective violence
automatically prefigures the unanimous forms of execution that are
egalitarian and performed at a distance, as we have noted.

178

T H E S C A P E G OAT
This does not mean that the great primordial legislators claimed by

so many religious traditions never existed. Primitive traditions, espe­
cially those that resemble each other, should always be taken seriously.
Great legislators existed, but they never promulgated legislation in their

lifetimes. It is obvious that they are identical with scapegoats whose
murder is scrupulously imitated, repeated, and perfected in ritual be­
cause of its effects on reconciliation. The effect is real because this mur­
der already resembles the type of execution that is derived from it and
that reproduces the same effect of putting an end to vengeance. It would
therefore seem to be derived from greater than human wisdom and can
only be attributed to the sacred scapegoat, like all institutions whose
origin lies in the mechanism of a victim. The supreme legislator is the
very essence of a scapegoat who has been made sacred.
Moses is one example of the scapegoat-legislator. His stammer is the
sign of a victim. We find traces in him of mythical guilt: the murder of
the Egyptian, the transgression that causes him to be forbidden entrance
into the Promised Land, his responsibility for the ten plagues of Egypt
which are diseases that remove all differences. All the stereotypes of
persecution are present except collective murder, which can be round on
the fringe of official tradition, just as for Romulus. Freud was not wrong
when he took seriously this hint of collective murder.
But, to return to the demons of Gerasa, is it reasonable to take into
consideration the stoning and the cliff-top execution when interpreting
this text? The context invites us to associate these two fOrms of execu­
tion. Stoning appears frequently in the Gospels and in the Acts: the
adulterous woman saved by Jesus; Stephen, the first martyr; even the
Passion is preceded by several attempts at stoning. There is also a sig­
nificant attempt to push Jesus off a cliff that failed. The scene takes place
in Nazareth. Jesus is received poorly in the city of his childhood; he can­
not accomplish miracles there. His preaching in the synagogue scandal­
izes his listeners. He leaves without any disturbance, except in Luke,
where the fOllowing happens:

When they heard this everyone in the synagogue was enraged. They sprang to
their feet and hustled him out of the town; and they took him up to the brow
of the hill their town was built on, intending to throw him down the cliff, but
he slipped through the crowd and walked away. (Luke 4:28-30)
This episode should be seen as a preliminary sketch and therefore
an announcement of the Passion. Its presence indicates that Luke, and

THE D EMONS OF GERASA

179

certainly the other evangelists, considered falling from a cliff-top and
stoning as equivalents of the Crucifixion. They understood what made
such an equivalence interesting. All forms of collective murder have the
same significance, and that significance is revealed by Jesus in his Pas­
sion. It is this revelation that is important, not the location of a particu­
lar cliff-top. If you listen to people who know Nazareth, the town and its
immediate surroundings do not fit the role Luke gives them. There is no
cliff.
Unfortunately, critics who have noticed this geographic inaccuracy
were never curious enough to discover why Luke endowed the town of
Nazareth with a nonexistent cliff. The Gospels are too interested in the
diverse forms of collective death to be interested in the topography of
Nazareth. Their real concern is with the demon's self-lapidation and the
fall of the herd of pigs from the cliff. But in these cases it is not the scape­
goat who goes over the cliff, neither is it a single victim nor a small num­
ber of victims, but a whole crowd of demons, two thousand swine
possessed by demons. Normal relationships are reversed. The crowd
should remain on top of the cliff and the victim fall over; instead, in this
case, the crowd plunges and the victim is saved.
The miracle of Gerasa reverses the universal schema of violence
fundamental to all societies of the world . The inversion appears in
certain myths but not with the same characters; it always ends in the
restoration of the system that had been destroyed or in the establishment
of a new system. In this case the result is quite differen t. The drowning
of the swine has a definitive character; it is an event without a future,
except fur the person cured by the miracle. This text suggests a differ­
ence not of degree but of nature between Jesus' miracle and the usual
healings. This difference of nature corresponds in actuality to a whole
group of concordant details. Modern critics have failed to notice them.
The fantastic aspects of the miracle seem too gratuitous to attract atten­
tion for very long. The request the demons make of Jesus, their dis­
orderly withdrawal into the swine, and the downfall of the latter all seem
like familiar old stories; whereas in fact the treatment of these themes is
extraordinary. It corresponds strictly to what is demanded at this point
by the revelation of the victim's mimeticism, even though the whole
style remains demonological.
If need be, the demons will tolerate being expelled provided they are
not expelled/rom their country. This would seem to mean that ordinary
exorcisms are always only local displacements, exchanges, and substitu-

180

tions which can always be produced within a structure without causing
any appreciable change or compromising the continuation of the whole
society. Traditional cures have a real but limited action to the degree that
they only improve the condition of individual X at the expense of
another individual, Y, or vice versa. In the language of demonology, this
means that the demons of X have left him to take possession ofY. The
healers modify certain mimetic relationships, but their little manipula­
tions do not compromise the balance of the system, which remains
unchanged. The system remains and should be defined as a system not
of men only but of men and their demons.
This total system is threatened by the cure of the possessed and the
concomitant drowning of the Legion. Because the Gerasenes suspect
this they are uneasy. The demons have an even clearer understanding.
They appear more lucid than the humans in this case which does not
prevent them from being blind in other areas and easy to deceive. These
themes are far richer in meaning than people have supposed. The quali­
ties attributed to the demons correspond strictly to the true characteris­
tics of this strange reality they are made to incarnate in the Gospels, the
mimetic disincarnation. As desire becomes more frantic and demonic,
it becomes more aware of its own laws, but this awareness does not pre·
vent enslavement. Great writers appreciate this paradox and display
it in their work. Dostoyevsky borrowed from the demons of Gerasa not
only the title for his novel The Demons but also the system of relation­
ships between characters and the dynamics of the abyss that sweeps the
system away.
The demons try to "negotiate" with Jesus, as they do with the local
healers. They deal as equal to equal with those whose power or lack of
power is scarcely different from their own. The negotiation with Jesus
is more apparent than real. This traveler is not initiated in any local cult;
he is not sent by anyone in the community. He does not need to make
concessions in order for the demons to leave the possessed. The permis­
sion he gives them to possess the swine has no consequence because it
has no lasting effect. It is enough for Jesus to appear somewhere to put
a stop to demons and challenge the inevitably demonic order of all
society. Demons cannot exist in his presence. They become extremely
agitated, have short periods of convulsion, and then tend to disintegrate
completely. This inevitable course of events is indicated by the miracle's
moment of crisis.
In every great defeat the finest maneuvers become the perfect in-

T H E DEMONS O F G ERASA

strument for the downfall. Our text succeeds in conferring that double
significance on the bargaining between the miracle worker and the de­
mons. The theme is borrowed from the practices of the shamans and
other healers, but here it is merely a vehicle for the meanings that tran­
scend it. The only hope of the demons in the presence of]esus is to re­
main on the edges of the universe where they formerly held sway in its
most evil-smelling corners. The demons turn to him willingly for shel­
ter from the abyss that threatens them. Panic-stricken, they decide in
haste, and for lack of a better choice, they become pigs. This is strangely
similar to what happens everywhere. Even becoming pigs, like Ulysses'
companions, the demons cannot survive. Drowning is final perdition. It
realizes the worst fears of the supernatural herd, expulsion from their own
country. This is Mark's remarkable expression; it takes note of the social
nature of the game, of the demoniac's role in what some call the "sym­
bolic?' Luke's text is also instructive. In showing us the demons begging
Jesus not to send them forever into the abyss, he clearly articulates the
definitive annihilation of the demoniac that is the major significance of
the text and explains the reaction of the Gerasenes themselves. These
unfortunate people fear that their precarious balance depends on the
demoniac, on the activities they share periodically and on the kind of
local celebrity their possessed citizen had become.
There is nothing in the possession that does not result from frantic
mimeticism. Hence the variant in Matthew that substitutes two pos­
sessed beings that are indistinguishable, and therefore mimetic, for the
solitary demoniac of the other two Gospels. Mark's text expresses basi­
cally the same thing, less obviously but therefore more essentially, by
presenting his single person possessed by a demon that is both one and
multiple, both singular and plural. This implies that the possessed is
possessed not by only one other, as Matthew suggests, but by all the
others inasmuch as they are both one and many, or in other words inas­
much as they form a society in the human sense of the term. This is also
the demonic sense, if one prefers, in that it is a society based on the col­
lective expulsion. This is precisely what the possessed is imitating. The
demons are in the image of the human group; they are the imago of this
group because they are its imitatio. Like the society of the Gerasenes at
the end of our text, the society of demons at the beginning possesses a
structure, a kind of organization; it is the unity of the multiple: "My
name is Legion; for there are many of us?' Just as one voice is raised at
the end to speak in the name of all the Gerasenes, one voice is raised at

182

T H E SCA PEG0AT

the beginning to speak i n the name of all the demons. These two voices
say the same thing. Since all coexistence between Jesus and the demons
is impossible, to beg him not to chase away the demons, when one is a
.
demon is the same as begging him to depart, if one is from Gerasa.
The essential proof of my thesis that the demons and Gerasenes are
identical is the behavior of the possessed insofar as he is the possessed
of these demons. The Gerasenes stone their victims and the demons
force theirs to stone themselves, which amounts to the same thing. This
archetypal possessed mimics the most basic social practice that literally
engenders society by transforming mimetic multiplicity in its most
atomized form into the strongest social unity which is the unanimity of
the original murder. In describing the unity of the multiple, the Legion
symbolizes the social principle itself, the type of organization that rests
not on the final expulsion of the demons but on the sort of equivocal and
mitigated expulsions that are illustrated by our possessed, expulsions
which ultimately end in the coexistence of men and demons.
I have said that Legion symbolizes the multiple unity of society and
that is true, but in the rightly famous sentence "My name is Legion; for
there are many of us;• it symbolizes that unity in the process of disin­
tegration since it is the inverse of social development that prevails. The
singular is irresistibly transformed into a plural, within the same single
sentence; it marks the falling back of unity into mimetic multiplicity
which is the first disintegrating effect of Jesus' presence. This is almost
like modem art. Je est un autre, says Matthew. Je is all the others, says
Mark.
It is legitimate to identify the herd of pigs with the crowd of
lynchers since the reference is explicit in at least one Gospel, that of
Matthew. I am referring to a very significant aphorism that appears not
far from the account of Gerasa. "Do not throw your pearls in front of
pigs or they may trample them and then tum on you and tear you to
pieces" (Matt. 7:6).
Yet in the account ofGerasa the lynchers experience the treatment
"normally" reserved for the victim. They are not stoned like the pos­
sessed, but they go over the steep bank, which amounts to the same
thing. Ifwe are to recognize how revolutionary this inversion is we must
transport it to classical Greek or Roman antiquity, which is more
respected than the Judaic world of the Bible. Imagine the Pharmakos
forcing the inhabitants of a Greek city, philosophers and mathemati­
cians alike, over a precipice. Instead of the outcast being toppled from

THE DEMONS 0F GERASA

the height ofthe Tarpeian rock it is the majestic consuls, virtuous Cato,
solemn juriconsults, the procurators of Judea, and all the rest of the
senatus populusque romanus. All of them disappear into the abyss while
the ex-victim, "clothed and in his full senses" calmly observes from
above the astounding sight.
The miracle's conclusion satisfies a certain appetite for revenge, but
can it be justified within the framework of my hypothesis? Does the ele­
ment of revenge compromise my thesis that the spirit of revenge is
absent in the Gospels? What is the force that drives the pigs into the sea
of Galilee ifnot our desire to see them fall or the violence of}esus him­
self? What can motivate a whole herd of pigs to destroy themselves with­
out being forced by someone? The answer is obvious. It is the crowd
mentality, that which makes the herd precisely a herd- in other words,
the irresistible tendency to mimeticism. One pig accidentally falling
into the sea, or the convulsions provoked by the demonic invasion, is
enough to cause a stupid panic in which all the others follow. The fran­
tic following fits well with the proverbial stubbornness of the species.
Beyond a certain mimetic threshold, the same that defined possession
earlier, the whole herd immediately repeats any conduct that seems out
of the ordinary, like fashions in modern society.
If just one animal were to stumble, accidentally, it would immedi­
ately start a new fashion of rushing headlong- the plunge into the abyss­
which would carry the last little pig eagerly away. The slightest mimetic
incitement can agitate a close-knit crowd. The weaker the purpose, the
more futile and fatal, then the more mysterious it will appear and the
more desire it will inspire. All the swine are scandalized and have there­
fore lost their balance. They are bound to be interested and even elec­
trified by a sudden, more radical, loss of balance. Everyone is groping
for that beautiful gesture, the gesture that cannot be undone. They rush
headlong after the "bold innovator?'
Whenever Jesus speaks he usually puts the mimeticism of the scan­
dalized in the place of the works of the devil. Ifwe do the same thing in
this context the mystery evaporates. These pigs are truly possessed in that
they are mimeticized up to their ears. We should not look in manuals of
demonology for references other than those in the Gospels. We should
turn instead to a more joyful, deeper literature. The suicidal demons of
Gerasa are Panurge's supersheep who do not even need a Dindenneau
to throw themselves into the sea. There is always a mimetic answer to
the questions posed in our text, and that answer is always the best.

CHAPTER FOURTEEN

Satan Divided against Himself
TEXTUAL ANALYSIS REVEALS nothing about the miraculous cures them­
selves. 1 It can only have bearing on the language describing them. The
Gospels speak the language of their universe. They therefore seem to
make ofJesus a healer among healers, while at the same time protesting
that the Messiah is very different. The text of Gerasa justifies this by
describing the destruction of all the demons and their universe, that
same universe which has provided the evangelists with the language to
describe the demons and their expulsion. The central subject, then,
is an expulsion, the expulsion that will rid the universe forever of its
demons and the demoniac.
In a few passages in the Gospels� Jesus himself uses the language of
demonology and expulsion. The most significant of these is a debate
with a hostile audience. The text is crucial and appears in all three
synoptic Gospels. Here it is in Matthew's version which is the richest.
Jesus has just cured someone possessed. The crowd is full of admiration
but there are members of the religious elite present- the "Pharisees" in
Matthew, the "scribes" in Mark-and they are suspicious of this cure.
All the people were astounded and said, "Can this be the Son of David?" But
when the Pharisees heard this they said, ''The man casts out devils only through
Beelzebul, the prince of devils:' Knowing what was in their minds he said to
them. "Every kingdom divided against itself is heading for ruin: and no town,
no household divided against itself can stand. Now if Satan casts out Satan, he

is divided against himself; so how can his kingdom stand? And if it is through
Beelzebul that I cast out devils, through whom do your own experts cast them
out? Let them be your judges, then. But if it is through the spirit of God that
I cast devils out, then know that the kingdom of God has overtaken you.
(Matthew 1 2:23-28)

It is impossible to understand this text in one reading. The imme­
diate reading leads into a deeper reading on another level. On initial
reading we recognize in the first sentence only an unarguable but com­
monplace principle that retains the wisdom of nations. English turns it
into a kind of maxim: Every kingdom divided against itself. . . shall not
stand.
The next sentence at first glance seems to apply this principle: "and
if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; so how can his
kingdom stand?" Jesus does not answer, but the answer is obvious. If it
is divided against itself, the kingdom of Satan will not stand. If the
Pharisees are truly hostile to Satan, they should not reproach Jesus for
casting out Satan by Satan; even if they are right, what Jesus has just
done will contribute to Satan's final destruction.
But here is a different supposition and a different question: "And if
it is through Beelzebul that I cast out devils, through whom do your
own experts cast them out?" If my action is prompted by the devil, what
about yours and your disciples� your spiritual sons? Jesus returns his
critics' accusation to them: it is they who cast out demons by means of
Satan, and he claims for himself a radically different way of expulsion,
casting out by the Spirit of God: "But if it is through the spirit of God
that I cast devils out, then know that the Kingdom of God has overtaken
you?'
Jesus seems to be involved in an exchange of arguments that is
bound to be sterile. Each of the healers claims to cast out demons by
God, and therefore to be more effective and more orthodox, whereas his
rival works through the devil. We find ourselves in the middle of mi­
metic competition in which each casts out the other, like Oedipus and
Tiresias, the rival prophets in Sophocles' Oedipus Rex. Violence is per­
vasive and everything can be reduced to a question offorce, as the sequel
to the passage implies. The presentation of the relationship between the
two methods of casting out devils is almost a caricature: "Or again, how
can anyone make his way into a strong man's house and burgle his prop­
erty unless he has tied up the strong man first? Only then can he burgle
his house" (Matt. 1 2:29).

186

T H E S CAPEGOAT

The first strong man i n this context i s the devil, who is presented as
the legitimate houseowner, or at least the original occupant of the
house. The stronger man who overcomes the former is God This is not
Jesus' viewpoint. God is no common housebreaker. Jesus adopts the
language of his interrogators, the language of rivals in the casting out of
demons, in order to reveal the system of violence and the sacred. God is
certainly stronger than Satan, but if so, in the sense implied in this pas­
sage, he would be just another Satan.
This is precisely how the Gerasenes interpret the explosive effect
Jesus has on their community. They have a strong man among them, the
demoniac Legion. This strong man leads them a tough life but he main·
tains some sort of order. Now comes Jesus, who must be even stronger
since he makes their strong man powerless. The Gerasenes fear that
Jesus will plunder all their possessions. That is why they are determined
to ask him to go away. They have no wish to exchange one tyrannical
master for a still more tyrannical one.
Jesus adopts the language ofhis universe- which is usually also the
language of the Gospels. The evangelists are not too sure of what is hap·
pening. Their text is extraordinarily elliptic and possibly even muti·
lated. Matthew at least understands that everything should not be taken
literally. There is an irony in the words we have just read that must be
exposed, a wealth of meaning that escapes us on the immediate argu­
mentative level, which is the only one apparent to the interrogators of
Jesus, and to most modern readers; Matthew precedes the quotation
with an important warning: "Knowing what was in their minds, he said
to them . ?'
Mark's warning is different and even more revealing; he alerts us to
the fact that it is a parab/e (Mark 3:23). This seems to me to be important
in defining a parable which is an indirect discourse that can but need
not include narrative elements since in this passage there are none. The
essential factor in the Gospel use of parable is Jesus' willingness to be
imprisoned within the representation of persecution from the persecu­
tors' standpoint, and to do so for the sake of his listeners who cannot
understand any other viewpoint, since they are prisoners of it them·
selves. Jesus uses the resources of the system in such a way as to warn
people of what awaits them in the only language they understand. By
doing this he reveals both the impending end of the system and the
incoherence and internal contradiction of the discourse. He hopes to
destroy the system in the minds of his listeners and at the same time to
.

make them understand another meaning, truer to his words, but more
difficult. This meaning, being a stranger to the violence of persecution,
can reveal the effect of imprisonment on each one of us.
In the light of our analysis a second meaning can easily be per­
ceived. The text actually says more than we have drawn from it here. It
summarizes our conclusions and clearly formulates the principle I have
uncovered, that violence casts itself out by violence, as the foundation
ofall human societies. As I have already observed the idea that a divided
community is headed for destruction would appear to be true but is only
a piece of common sense. To begin the debate, Jesus makes a suggestion
to which everyone will agree. The second sentence then appears as a
particular instance of the first. What is true of every kingdom, city, and
house must be true of the kingdom of Satan.
But the kingdom of Satan is not one among others. The Gospels
state explicitly that Satan is the principle of every kingdom. How is that
possible? By being the principle of violent expulsion and the deceit it
produces. The kingdom of Satan is none other than the violence that
casts itself out in all the rites and exorcisms alluded to by the Pharisees,
and even before that in the original, hidden deed that serves as a model
for all these rites, the unanimous and spontaneous murder of a scape­
goat. This is the complex and complete definition of the kingdom of
Satan provided by the second sentence. It announces not only what will
finally destroy Satan but also what originally brought him into existence
and established his power, his founding principle. What is strange is
that the founding principle and the principle ofultimate destruction are
one and the same. This is disconcerting to the ignorant, but nothing in
it need disconcert us. We know already that the principle of mimetic
desire, its rivalries, and the internal divisions it creates are identical with
the equally mimetic principle that unifies society: the scapegoat
This is the process that is repeatedly unfolded for us. It is the reason
for the quarrel between fraternal enemies that precedes the murder of
John the Baptist, just as we have seen at the beginning of innumerable
myths. The one finishes normally by killing the other in order to provide
men with a norm. Far from being the simple application of a principle
that was stated in the first sentence, the second sentence states the prin­
ciple that is applied in the first sentence. The order of these sentences
must be reversed. The text should be reread starting with the end. Then
we understand why the first sentence remains in peoples' memories.
There is something in it which goes beyond the everyday wisdom that

188

TH E SCAPEG0AT

was at first apparent. The Jerusalem Bible, from which I quoted, does
not convey this very well because it does not repeat the initial adjective
every, which appears twice in the original Greek. Every kingdom divided
against itself is heading for ruin, and every city or house, divided against
itself. The repetition of every emphasizes the impression of symmetry
among all the forms of community mentioned here. The text enumer­
ates all the human societies, from the greatest to the smallest, the king­
dom, the city, the house. For reasons that at first elude us, care is taken
not to omit any category, and the repetition of every underlines that
intention even more, although its importance is not apparent, immedi­
ately. This is not fortuitous or an accident of style that has no relation
to the meaning. There is a second meaning that cannot escape us.
The text is, in fact, insisting that all kingdoms, all cities, and all
houses are divided against themselves. In other words all human com­
munities without exception are based on the one principle, both con­
structive and destructive, that is found in the second sentence; these are
all examples of the kingdom of Satan, and it is not this kingdom of Satan
or kingdom of violence which serves as one example of society, in the
empirical sense of sociologists. Thus the first two sentences are richer
than they seem; an entire sociology or basic anthropology is summa­
rized in them. That is not all. We can now begin to understand the third,
and particularly the fourth sentence, which seems the most enigmatic:
"And if it is through Beelzebul that I cast out devils, through whom do
your own experts cast them out? Let them be your judges, then?'
Why should the spiritual sons, the disciples and imitators, become
judges of their masters and models? The word for judges is kritai; it
evokes the idea of crisis and division. Under the effect of mimetic escala­
tion, the internal division of every "satanic" community is exacerbated;
the difference between legitimate and illegitimate violence diminishes,
expulsions become reciprocal; sons repeat and reinforce the violence of
their fathers with even more deplorable results for everybody; finally
they understand the evil of the paternal example and curse their own
fathers. They pass negative judgment, as implied by the word kritai, on
everything that precedes them just as we do today.
The concept of the existence of an all-powerful divine violence
seems to emerge from our text; it is even explicit as in the account of the
miracle of Gerasa. But if the reader goes beyond a certain point, the
interpretation is reversed by the observation that divine expulsion does
not exist or, rather it only exists for the representation of persecution

SATAN DIVIDED AGAINST H I MSELF

189

from the persecutor's standpoint, for the spirit of reciprocal accusation
otherwise known as Satan himself. The force of expulsion always
originates in Satan, and God has nothing to do with it; it is more than
enough to put an end to the "kingdom of Satan:• These men are divided
by their mimeticism, "possessed" by Satan, each in turn casting the
other out to the point of total extinction.
If self divided against self (mimetic rivalry) and the expulsion of
expulsion (the scapegoat mechanism) are principles of both decomposi­
tion and composition for human societies, why does Jesus not mention
the latter in all his final apocalyptic pronouncements? Perhaps I am
right in identifying mimetic violence as the source ofboth order and dis­
order. Possibly the text is as grossly polemic, as unconsciously mimetic
and grossly dualistic as the immediate reading suggests.
It seems that Satan has never ceased to expel Satan, and there is no
reason to believe he will cease in the foreseeable future. Jesus speaks as
if the satanic principle had used up its force for order and as ifall social
order would henceforth succumb to its own disorder. The principle of
order is merely alluded to in the first two sentences, like a stylistic effect,
something that has more or less come to its end, condemned to follow
the path to destruction, which constitutes the only explicit message that
is accessible to most readers.
The meaning of order is there, but it is precisely its presence that
determines the vestigial character of the treatment of it. The reason lies
in the fact that the violence of the cultural order is revealed in the
Gospels, both in the account of the Passion and in all the other episodes
we have read, including this one, and the cultural order cannot survive
such a revelation. Once the basic mechanism is revealed, the scapegoat
mechanism, that expulsion of violence by violence, is rendered useless
by the revelation. It is no longer of interest. The interest of the Gospels
lies in the future offered mankind by this revelation, the end of Satan's
mechanism. The good news is that scapegoats can no longer save men,
the persecutors' accounts of their persecutions are no longer valid, and
truth shines into dark places. God is not violent, the true God has noth­
ing to do with violence, and he speaks to us not through distant inter­
mediaries but directly. The Son he sends us is one with him. The
Kingdom of God is at hand.
If it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the King­
dom of God has come upon you. The Kingdom of God has nothing in
common with the kingdom of Satan and the kingdoms of this world

THE SCAP EGOAT

based on the satanic principle ofinternal division and expulsion. It has
nothing to do with expulsion. Jesus agrees to debate his own action in
terms of expulsion and violence because those are the only terms his
questioners understand. But he is telling them of an event that has noth­
ing in common with this language. !fit is by the Spirit of God that I cast
out demons, then soon there will be no more demons or expulsions for
the kingdom of violence and expulsion will rapidly be destroyed. The
Kingdom of God is at hand/or you. His listeners are addressed directly.
The Kingdom arrives like a bolt of lightning. Like the bridegroom of
the foolish and the wise virgins, it has delayed a long time but has sud­
denly arrived.
The Kingdom of God has arrived for you who are listening to me
now, but not for those Gerasenes whom I have just left without saying
anything to them because they have not yet reached the point you are at.
Jesus intervenes when the time has come or, in other words, when vio­
lence can no longer cast out violence and internal division has reached
its crisis. The victim-scapegoat is at the point of no return. Though for
a while he may seem to bring back the old order, in reality it is destroyed
forever. Instead of casting it out he is himself cast out, thereby revealing
to men the mystery of expulsion, the secret on which rests the positive
dimension of Satan's power, its organizing force of violence.
Ever attentive to the historical aspects ofthe revelation, Matthew, in
his account of Gerasa, includes a statement by his two possessed that
suggests a temporary separation between a universe that is based on the
law and one that is not: "What do you want with us, Son of God? Have
you come here to torture us before the time?" (Matt. 8:29). This com­
plaint is significant in the context of our current analysis. I pointed out
that the crowd ofGerasenes is less like a mob than the shepherdless flock
to which Jesus usually preached. The Gerasene community is still more
"structured?' Paganism is responsible for this. This does not mean we
should rate paganism more highly than Judaism. It suggests, rather, that
paganism has not yet reached the same critical point in its evolution.
The final crisis that determines the final revelation both is and is not
specific. In principle it is the same as the disintegration of all sacrificial
systems that are based on the "satanic" expulsion of violence by vio­
lence. For better or for worse, the Gospel revelation makes the crisis in­
evitable. By exposing the secret of the persecutors' representation it
prevents the mechanism of the victim from ever functioning and creat-

SATAN D I VIDED AGAINST H I M S E LF

ing, at the height of mimetic disorder, a new order of ritual expulsion
that replaces the old.
Sooner or later the ferment ofthe Gospels will cause the breakup of
the social order it infiltrates and of all similar societies, even so-called
Christian societies that claim to be based on it. This claim is partially
true, but rests upon a partial misunderstanding, a necessarily sacrificial
misunderstanding, which is rooted in the deceptive similarity between
the Gospels and other religious mythological charters. "And if a house
is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand;' Mark tells
us, but that collapse is not just a stronger expulsion initiated by God or
Jesus. It is the end of all expulsion. That is why the coming of the King­
dom of God means destruction for those who only understand destruc­
tion and reconciliation for those who always seek reconciliation.
The logic of the kingdom that cannot stand if it is always divided
against itself has always been true in the absolute but was never true in
reality because the hidden scapegoat mechanism always restored sacri­
ficial differentiation and expelled violence by violence. Finally, that
logic becomes a historical reality in the Crucifixion, first for the Jews
and then for the pagans, the Gerasenes of the modern world who have
always behaved a little like the people of Gerasa while claiming to be
guided by Jesus. They are happy to think that nothing so drastic can
happen to their communities, and are convinced that the catastrophes
announced by the Gospels are imaginary.
An initial reading of the account of the demons ofGerasa gives the
impression that everything is based on a logic of double expulsion.
There were no decisive results from the first expulsion. It was a petty
squabble between the demons and their Gerasenes who got along like
thieves at a fair. Jesus was responsible for the second expulsion that
made a clean sweep of the whole place and its inhabitants.
The same double expulsion, the one within the system it stabilizes,
the other external to that same system that it destroys, is explicitly men­
tioned in the text we have just read: "And if it is through Beelzebul that
I cast out devils, through whom do your own experts cast them out!' A more
profound comprehension reveals that the divine power is not destruc­
tive; it does not expel anyone. The truth offered to mankind unleashes
the forces of Satan, the destructive mimeticism, by taking away its
power of self-regulation. The fundamental ambiguity of Satan makes
divine action superficially ambiguous. Jesus brings war into the divided

192

THE SCAPEGOAT

world of Satan because, fundamentally, he brings peace. People do not
or pretend not to understand this. The text is admirably suited to be read
by both those who understand and those who do not. The sentences
dealing with communities divided against themselves and Satan casting
out Satan indicate both the power of satanic mimesis to regulate itself
and the loss of that power. The text does not explicitly identify the prin­
ciple of order and disorder, but conveys it in sentences with double
meaning. The endless fascination of these sentences lies in the
chiaroscuro of the truth they contain that must not be highlighted if it
is to function in the text exactly as it functions in reality. Those who do
not see it remain in Satan's universe, on the level of the immediate read­
ing, believing that there exists a divine violence, the rival of Satan's
violence, and remaining prisoners of the persecution mentality. Those
who see the truth understand that Satan's kingdom is headed for de­
struction because of the revelation of the truth about it, and they are
liberated from the persecution mentality.
Thus we come to understand what is involved in the Kingdom of
God and why it does not represent for men an unmitigated blessing. It
has nothing to do with a flock of sheep grazing in an eternally green
pasture. It brings men face to face with their hardest task in history.
Compared to ourselves, the people of Gerasa are honest and sympa­
thetic. They do not yet behave like imperious users of the consumer
society. They admit that it is difficult for them to live without
scapegoats and demons. In all the texts we have read the demonological
perspective persists but is subverted. To get rid of it completely we only
need to broaden a little the jurisdiction of the skanda/on as defined by
Jesus, whose prodigious power can be seen in operation everywhere.
The texts I have interpreted are representative of all the synoptic
Gospels. To put an end once and for all to the demon, we need only
focus on the notion of scandal and all that goes with it to help us under­
stand the problem of mimesis and its expulsions.
Mark and Matthew have good reason to warn us not to take too liter­
ally the greatest of all Jesus' demonological statements. We need only
consult a dictionary to learn that the parabolic distortion of a text in­
volves a certain concession to the mythological representation of vio­
lence that results from the collective murder of a scapegoat. Paraballo
means to throw the crowd something edible in order to assuage its appe­
tite for violence, preferably a victim, someone condemned to- death .

SATAN DIVIDED AGAINST HIMSELF

193

Obviously, this is a way out of a very difficult situation. The speaker has
recourse to a parable -that is, a metaphor-in order to prevent the crowd
from turning on him. Ultimately, there is no discourse that is not a para­
ble. All human language, and other cultural institutions, in fact, origi­
nated in collective murder. After some of Jesus' most hard-hitting
parables the crowd often makes a movement of violence, but Jesus
escapes because his hour has not come.
By warning the readers that Jesus speaks in parables, the Evan­
gelists alert the readers to the distortion of persecution. Here we are
clearly being warned about the language of expulsion. There is no other
alternative. Ifwe do not recognize the parabolic dimension of the expul­
sion we will be duped by violence. Our reading will have been of the
type that Jesus warned must be avoided but was inevitable;
Then the disciples went up to him and asked, "Why do you talk to them in para­
bles?'' "Because;' he replied, "the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven are re­
vealed to you, but they are not revealed to them. For anyone who has will be
given more, and he will have more than enough: but from anyone who has not,
even what he has will be taken away. The reason I talk to them in parables is
that they look without seeing and listen without hearing or understanding:'
(Matt. 1 3 : 1 0-14)

Mark at this point connects the parable even more clearly than
Matthew to the persecution mentality. For those caught in it everything
appears in parables. Instead of freeing us, the parable, when taken liter­
ally, reinforces the walls of our prison. This is the meaning of the follow­
ing lines. It would not be accurate to conclude that the parable is not
aimed at converting the listener. Even here, Jesus is talking to his
disciples:
To you has been given the secret of the Kingdom of God, but for those outside
everything is in parables; so that they may see and see again, but not perceive;
may hear and hear again, but not understand; otherwise they might be con­
verted and be forgiven." (Mark 4 : 10-12)

EvE N I N THE TEXTS generally described as "archaic," belief in demons
may seem to flourish but in reality always tends toward suppression.
This is true in the dialogue on expulsion we have just read and also in
the miracle of Gerasa. We are not aware of the ultimate suppression
because it is expressed in the contradictory language of the expulsion

194

THE SCAPEGOAT

that is expelled and the demon that is cast out. The demon is sent back
to the nothingness with which he is in a way "consubstantial;' the noth­
ingness of his own existence.
This is the meaning ofJesus' expression: "I watched Satan fall like
lightning from heaven" (Luke 1 0: 1 8). There is only one transcendence
in the Gospels, the transcendence of divine love that triumphs over all
manifestations of violence and the sacred by revealing their nothing­
ness. A careful reading of the Gospels shows us that Jesus prefers the
language of skandalon to that of the demonic while the opposition is
true for the disciples and editors ofthe Gospels. We should therefore not
be surprised to find a certain contrast between the fulgurating words
attributed to Jesus, which are often not very coherent, and the narrative
passages, particularly the accounts of the miracles, which are better
organized from a literary perspective but lag somewhat behind the
thought that emerges from the direct quotations. All of this would be
understandable if the disciples were really as described in the Gospels
themselves, very attentive and full of good will but not always capable
of understanding fully what their master did and said. The description
of Peter's denial already suggested that conclusion. The narrative pas­
sages are more likely to be directly dependent on the disciples than the
transcription of Jesus' words.
Only Jesus can master the language of skandalon: the most impor­
tant passages clearly reveal that the two languages are applied to the
same objects, and they show us Jesus translating the demonic logos in
terms of mimetic scandal. This is achieved in the famous admonition to
Peter: "Get behind me, Satan! you are a scandal to me [an obstacle]
because the way you think is not God's way but man's?' Did Jesus in that
moment see in Peter someone possessed by Satan in the sense that the
witch-hunters used the expression? The next sentence which shows
Peter's action as typically human proves that this is not so: "the way you
think is not God's way but man's?'
The language of skandalon substitutes for the salutary but blind rear
of hell an analysis of the reason why men fall into the trap of mimetic
circularity. By exposing Jesus to the contagious temptation of his own
worldly desire, Peter transforms the divine mission into a worldly un­
dertaking that must inevitably come up against rival ambitions which it
arouses or by which it is aroused, Peter's own for example. In this con­
text Peter plays the role of Satan's substitute, suppositus, the model­
obstacle of mimetic desire.

SATAN D I V I D E D A G A I N S T H IM S E L F

A close correspondence exists between what the Gospels tell us of
demons and the truth of mimetic relationships as defined by Jesus and
as revealed in certain great literary works or in theoretical analysis. This
is not true ofmost texts that reflect a beliefin demons, but most contem­
porary commentators fail to recognize such a distinction and consider all
such texts to be contaminated by the same superstition without ever
really examining the content. The Gospels, in fact, are not only superior
to all the texts placed in the category of magical thought but are also
superior to all the modern interpretations of human relationships.
Their superiority lies both in the mimetic concept and in the combina­
tion of mimesis with demonology found in a text such as Gerasa. The
demonological vision powerfully incorporates the unity and diversity of
certain individual and social attitudes in a unique way. This is why great
writers such as Shakespeare and Dostoyevsky, or George Bemanos later,
have resorted to the language ofdemonology in order to avoid the useless
platitudes of the pseudo-scientific knowledge of their epoch and ours.
By acknowledging the existence of the demon we recognize the
force of desire and hatred, envy and jealousy, at work among men. Its
effects are far more insidious and twisted, its reversals and metamor­
phoses more paradoxical and unexpected, and its consequences more
complex than anything man has since imagined in his eagerness to
account for human behavior without supernatural intervention. Yet its
principle is simple, almost simplistic, since the demon is both very
intelligent and very stupid. The mimetic nature of the demon is explicit
since, among other things, he is the monkey of God In speaking of the
uniformly "demonic" character of trance, ritual possession, hysterical
crisis, and hypnosis, we are confirming the true unity of the
phenomena, the common basis that must be identified if psychiatry is
to make progress. That basis is the conflictual mimesis that Jean-Michel
Oughourlian traces.
But the superiority of the demonic theme is shown in its unrivaled
ability to assemble in one concept the divisive force (diabolos), the "per­
verse effects;' the generative power of all disorder on all levels of human
relationships on the one hand and the power of union that creates social
order on the other. This theme accomplishes effortlessly what sociology,
anthropology, psychoanalysis, and cultural theory have constantly at­
tempted without success. The Gospels provide us with the principle
that allows us to distinguish social transcendence and the immanence of
individual relations and simultaneously unify them by controlling the

196

THE SCAPEGOAT

relationship between what the French psychoanalysis call the symbolic
and the imaginary.
The demonic allows, on the one hand, for every tendency toward
conflict in human relations and for the centrifugal force at the heart of
the community, and, on the other hand, for the centripetal force that
brings men together, the mysterious glue of that same community. In
order to transform this demonology into true knowledge we must follow
the path indicated by the Gospels and complete the translation that they
begin. It is obvious that the same force that divides people by mimetic
rivalry also unites them by the mimetic unanimity of the scapegoat.
Clearly, this is what John is speaking of when he presents Satan as
"liar and the father of lies" because he is "a murderer from the start"
(John 8:44). This lie is discredited by the Passion which shows the
victim's innocence. If Satan's defeat is so closely linked to the precise
moment of the Passion this is because the truthful account of this event
will provide men with what is needed to escape the eternal lie and recog­
nize that the victim is slandered. Thanks to his well-known mimetic
ability Satan succeeds in making the victim's guilt credible. Satan, in
Hebrew, means the accuser. All the meanings and symbols are inter­
woven so carefully that they constitute a structure of flawless rationality.
Could this be pure coincidence?
With the deepening of the mimetic crisis, desire and its conflicts
become more immaterial because they have lost their object. As the situ­
ation becomes more "perverse" it even fosters belief in a purely spiritual
mimesis; relationships inevitably become increasingly obsessive and
autonomous. Demonology is not completely duped by this autonomy
since it tells us of the absolute need that demons have to possess a living
being in order to survive. The demon is not capable of existing apart
from that possession. But its existence is strengthened as men's resist­
ance to mimetic urges weakens. The principal examples of this are to be
found in the great scene of Jesus' temptation in the desert. The most
important of these is the last, which shows us Satan desirous of takin�
God's place as an object of adoration, as a model of a necessarily frus­
trated imitation. This imitation makes Satan the mimetic skanda/on we
see in Jesus' response which is almost identical with the response he
gives Peter when he treats him as Satan. The same Greek verb, upage,
begone, appears in both episodes, and the scandalous obstacle is im­
plied. To adore Satan is to aspire to world domination. It involves
reciprocal relationships ofidolatry and hate which can only end in false

SA TAN D I V I D E D AGAI NST H I M S E L F

gods of violence and the sacred as long as men maintain the illusion.
When that illusion is no longer possible, total destruction will follow:
Next, taking him to a very high mountain, the devil showed him all the king­
doms of the world and their splendour. "I will give you all these;• he said, "if
you fall at my feet and worship me:• Then Jesus replied, "Be off, Satan! For
scripture says:

Hlu must worship the Lord your God,
and serve him alone." (Matt. 4:8- 1 0)

CHAPTER FIFTEEN

History and the Paraclete
ALL TilE PASSAGES we have studied in the Gospels refer to phenomena of

collective persecution that are either discredited or condemned in the
sense that we discredit or condemn similar phenomena in our own
history. The Gospels contain a range oftexts that fit diverse situations­
everything, in fact, that is needed for the critical analysis of representa­
tions of persecution from the persecutors' standpoint and resistance to
the mimetic and violent mechanisms in which they are imprisoned.
The undermining of mythical beliefs begins with the acts of vio­
lence against those the Christians call martyrs. We see them as innocent
people who are persecuted. This truth has been transmitted by history,
and the perspective of the persecutors has not prevailed. The victim
would have to be glorified as a result of the persecution in order to have
sacredness in the mythological sense. The crimes imagined by the
persecutors would have to be accepted as real.
In the case ofthe martyrs, there was no lack of accusations. Rumors
were rife, and they have been believed by distinguished writers. These
were classical crimes of myth, the typical reflection of mob violence.
Christians were accused of infanticide and other crimes against their
own families. Their intense communal life aroused suspicions of incest.
These transgressions, associated with a refusal to worship the emperor,
assumed a social dimension for the populace and for the authorities. If
Rome burned, the Christians probably set fire to it.
There truly would be a mythological genesis ifall these crimes were
incorporated in the final apotheosis. The Christian saint would become
a mythological hero. He would embody aspects of both supernatural

H I S TORY AND T H E P ARACLETE

199

benefactor and all-powerful troublemaker, capable of punishing each
act of negligence or indifference toward him by sending a plague. What
is essentially characteristic of the mythological quality of the sacred is
its dual nature - it is both harmful and beneficial. It leaves the impres­
_
sion of a double transcendence, a paradoxical conjunction, because we
understand it from a Christian perspective considered by us to be the
norm, whereas in fact it is unique.
The innocence of the martyr is never in doubt. "They hated me
[without a cause]?' The Christian passion produces its first fruit. The
spirit of vengeance leads vigorous rear-guard actions, but the martyrs
nonetheless pray for their executioners: "Father, forgive them, they
know not what they do?'
Admittedly, innocent victims were rehabilitated before Christianity.
Socrates, Antigone, and others are rightly mentioned in this context.
There are aspects similar to the Christian understanding of the martyr,
but they are isolated in nature and do not affect any society in its totality.
The singularity of the martyr is due to the fact that his sacralization fails
to take place even under conditions that are most favorable to the crea�
tion of the sacred- the crowd's emotion and their religious passion for
persecution. The proofis that all the stereotypes of persecution are pres­
ent. From the perspective of the majority, the Christians constitute a
disturbing minority, richly equipped with the selective signs of a vic­
tim. They belong mainly to the lower classes, and many of them are
women or slaves. But nothing is transfigured; the persecution is por­
trayed as it really is.
To canonize someone is not the same as to make him sacred. Admit­
tedly, there are traces of the survival of the primitive quality of the
sacred in the glorification of the martyrs, and later in the lives of medi­
eval saints. I mentioned some of them in connection with Saint Sebas­
tian. The mechanisms of violence and the sacred are a part of the
fascination exerted by the martyrs. There might be said to be a virtue in
the blood spilled in ancient times that became exhausted unless it was
renewed from time to time by new blood. This is certainly true of the
Christian martyrs, and we should be aware of its importance in the dis­
tillation of the phenomenon and the strength of its diffusion. Neverthe­
less, the essential element lies elsewhere.
Most observers these days, even Christians, dwell primarily on the
sacrificial traces. They believe they have discovered the link between the

200

T H E SCAPEGOAT

theological aspects of Christianity, which are purely sacrificial, and its
social efficacy, which is also sacrificial. This concept is real but second­
ary and should not conceal from them the specifically Christian process,
which acts as a revelation, in a way that is contrary to sacrifice.
That two contrary actions can be combined only appears to be para­
doxical. Or rather it re-creates the entire paradox of the Passion and the
Gospels which lend themselves to secondary and superficial mytho­
logical crystallizations because they must reproduce the mythological
process with extreme exactitude in order to reveal and completely sub­
vert that process.
Even a purely sacrificial theology ofthe Gospels must ultimately be
based on the Epistle to the Hebrews and certainly does not justify the
exclusive importance given to the sacrificial fringe in the phenomenon
of the martyrs. The Epistle does not succeed in defining the real sin­
gularity ofthe Passion, but it makes an attempt and accomplishes some­
thing important by portraying the death of Christ as the perfect and
definitive sacrifice, which makes all other sacrifices outmoded and any
further sacrificial undertaking unacceptable. This definition still does
not uncover what I have tried to reveal -the absolute specificity of
Christianity. But it does prevent a pure and simple return to the repet­
itive and primitive tradition of sacrifice, the kind of return we find in
readings that limit martyrdom to mechanisms of violence and the
sacred.
The failure of mythological genesis, in the case of the martyrs,
makes it possible for historians to understand in a rational light for the
first time and on a large scale the representations of persecution and
their corresponding acts of violence. We come upon the crowds in the
course of their mythopoetic activity, and it is not as pretty a sight as our
theoreticians of myth and literature imagine. Fortunately for anti­
Christian humanism, it is still possible to deny the presence of the proc­
ess that gives birth to mythology in every other context.
Because of its revelation by the Passion, the scapegoat mechanism
is no longer capable of producing true myth. Therefore there is no direct
proof of the involvement of that generative mechanism. If, on the co n­
trary, it had maintained its efficacy, there would have been no <;hris­
tiliriity but merely another mythology. Everything would have come to
us in the transfigured form of truly mythological themes and motifs.
The end result would have been the same: the generative mechanism

H I S TORY A NO T H E P A R A CL ET E

201

would still not have been recognized. Anyone who recognized it would
have been accused of mistaking words for things and inventing
the existence of a real persecution behind the noble mythological
imagination.
I hope I have succeeded in showing the possibility and, indeed, cer­
tainty of proof, but it must take the indirect paths that we have followed.
The Passion always acts as a model in the lives of the saints, and finds
a way into the particular circumstances of such and such a persecution.
But this is no mere rhetorical exercise or formal piety. Any critique of
representations of persecution must begin here. Such a critique may
yield rigid, clumsy and only partial results, yet the process was incon­
ceivable until then and demands a long apprenticeship.
The rehabilitation of martyrs will draw accusations of partisanship
that are rooted in the community of belief between victims and
defenders. "Christianity" only defends its own victi�s. Once victorious,
it becomes, in turn, a tyrannical oppressor and persecutor. As for Chris­
tianity's own acts of violence, it bears witness to the same blindness as
its own persecutors.
All of which is true, just as true as the martyr's sacrificial connota­
tion; but again, a secondary truth is only concealing the primary one. A
formidable revolution is about to take place. Men, or at least certain
men, will not allow themselves to be seduced by the persecutions that
are claimed by their own beliefs and especially by "Christianity" itself.
The resistance to persecution arises from the very heart of the universe
of persecution. I am thinking of the process that I described at length
earlier, the demystification of witch-hunts and a society's abandonment
of the crude aspects of the magical concepts of persecution.
During the course of Western history representations of persecution
from the persecutor's perspective gradually weaken and disappear.
There are not necessarily fewer or less intense acts of violence; but it
does mean that the persecutors could no longer permanently impose
their own perspective on those around them. Centuries were needed to
demystify medieval persecutions; a few years suffice to discredit contem­
porary persecutors. Even if some totalitarian system were to control the
entire planet tomorrow, it would not succeed in making its own myth,
or the magical aspect of its persecution, prevail. The process is the same
as for the Christian martyrs, but it has been cleansed of the last traces
of the sacred and radicalized since it demands no community of belief

202

TH E S CAP EG 0AT

among the victims and those who demystify the system o ftheir persecu­
tion. This is evident in the language that is always used in preference to
any other.
In classical Latin persequi bears no connotation of injustice; the term
simply signifies; to prosecute before a court. The Christian apologists,
especially Lactantius and Tertullian, are responsible for the modern
implications of persecutio, which stems from a very un-Roman sense of
legal apparatus in the service not of justice but of injustice, systemati­
cally warped by the distortions of persecution. Similarly, in Greek,
martyr signifies witness, and it is the Christian influence that developed
its current sense of an innocent person persecuted, a heroic victim of an
unjust act of violence.
When we exclaim: "The victim is a scapegoat;' we resort to a bibli­
cal expression that no longer has the same significance as it had for the
participants in the ritual of that name. It has the meaning of the inno­
cent lamb in Isaiah or the Lamb of God in the Gospels. Every explicit
reference to the Passion has disappeared, but the Passion is always juxta­
posed with representations of persecution from the perspective of perse­
cutors. The same model serves as a cipher for decoding, but it is so well
assimilated that it is used mechanically without any explicit reference to
its Judaic and Christian origins.
When the Gospels proclaim that Christ henceforth has taken the
place of all victims, we only recognize grandiloquent sentimentality and
piety, whereas in the Gospel reference it is literally true. We have
learned to identify our innocent victims only by putting them in
Christ's place, as Raymond Schwager well understood.1 The Gospels,
of course, are interested not in the intellectual operation they enable,
but in the ethical change that they can possibly, but not necessarily,
trigger:
"When the Son of Man comes in his glory, escorted by all the angels, then he
will take his seat on his throne of glory. All the nations will be assembled before
him and he will separate men one from another as the shepherd separates sheep
from goats. He will place the sheep on his right hand and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right hand, 'Come, you whom my Father
has blessed, take for your heritage the kingdom prepared for you since the
foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food; I was thirsty
I . Schwager, Brauchen wir einen Siindenbock? This book sheds important light on the

and you gave me drink; I was a stranger and you made me welcome; naked and
you clothed me, sick and you visited me, in prison and you came to see me:
Then the virtuous will say to him in reply, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry
and feed you; or thirsty and gave you drink? When did we see you a stranger and
make you welcome; naked and clothe you; sick or in prison and go to see you?"
And the King will answer, 'I tell you solemnly, in so far as you did this to one
of the least of these brothers of mine, you did it to me: Next he will say to those
on his left hand, 'Go away from me, with your curse upon you to the eternal fire

food; I was thirsty and you never gave me anything to drink; I was a stranger and
you never made me welcome, naked and you never clothed me, sick and in

did we see you hungry or thirsty, a stranger or naked, sick or in prison, and did
not come to your help?' Then he will answer, 'I tell you solemnly, in so fur as

And they will go away to eternal punishment, and the virtuous to eternal life:'
(Matt. 2 5 : 3 1 -46)

The text has the quality of a parable. In order to speak to violent
people who are unaware of their own violence, it resorts to the language
of violence, but the real meaning is completely clear. Henceforth, it is
not the explicit reference to Jesus that counts. Only our actual attitude
when confronted with victims determines our relationship with the
exigencies brought about by the revelation which can become effective
without any mention of Christ himself.
When the Gospel text speaks ofits universal diffusion, this does not
imply utopian illusions about either the nature of the attachments to it
or the practical results of the parallel process of penetration. It foresees
both the superficial attachment of a still-pagan universe-the "Chris­
tian" Middle Ages- and the indifferent or ill-tempered rejection of the
succeeding universe. The latter is secretly more affected by the revela­
tion and often constrained for this reason to oppose the pagan Chris­
tianity of former times with anti-Christian parodies of the Gospel
imperative. The death of Jesus is ultimately decided not by the cry of
"Crucify him" but rather by "Free Barabbas" (Matt. 27:21; Mark 1 5: 1 1;
Luke 2 3 : 1 8).
The evidence ofthe texts would seem irrefutable, but every refer­
ence to it raises a veritable storm of protest, a chorus of henceforth
almost universal exclamations, for the last titular Christians readily join
in. Perhaps the texts are· so strong that from now on just to quote them
and indicate their relevance will seem polemical and indicative of a

204

persecutor. Many, however, still cling to the modernist, traditional
vision of Christianity as persecuting. This vision is based on two types
of ideas that are too different in appearance for their agreement not to
appear decisive.
Beginning with Constantine, Christianity triumphed at the level of
the state and soon began to cloak with its authority persecutions similar
to those in which the early Christians were victims. Like so many previ­
ous religions, ideological, and political enterprises, Christianity
suffered persecution whilei.Lwas weak and became the persecutor as
soon as it gained strength. This vision of a Christianity that persecuted
as much as or more than other religions is strengthened rather than
diminished by the modern Western world's very aptitude for decoding
representations of persecution. As long as this aptitude was limited to
the immediate historical environment, i.e., the superficially Chris­
tianized universe, religious persecution- violence sanctioned or insti·
gated by religion- appeared as a monopoly of that universe.
On the other hand, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,
Westerners made an idol of science and believed in an autonomous
scientific spirit of which they were both the inventors and the product.
They replaced the ancient myths with those ofprogress, which might be
called the myth of perpetual modern superiority, the myth of a human­
ity that, through its own instrumentality, gradually became liberated
and divine.
The scientific spirit cannot come first. It presupposes the renuncia­
tion of a former preference for the magical causality of persecution so
well defined by the ethnologists. Instead of natural, distant, and inacces­
sible causes, humanity has always preferred causes that are significant
from a socialperspective and permit of corrective intervention-victims. In
order to lead men to the patient exploration of natural causes, men must
first be turned away from their victims. This can only be done by show­
ing them that from now on persecutors "hate without cause" and with·
out any appreciable result. In order to achieve this miracle, not only
among certain exceptional individuals as in Greece, but for entire popu·
lations, there is need of the extraordinary combination of intellectual,
moral, and religious factors found in the Gospel text.
The invention of science is not the reason that there are no longer
witch-hunts, but the fact that there are no longer witch-hunts is the
reason that science has been invented. The scientific spirit, like the
spirit of enterprise in an economy, is a by-product of the profound action

H I S T O RY A N D T H E P A R A C L E T E

205

of the Gospel text. The modern Western world has forgotten the revela­
tion in favor of its by-products, making them weapons and instruments
of power; and now the process has turned against it. Believing itself a
liberator, it discovers its role as persecutor. Children curse their fathers
and become their judges. Contemporary scholars discover traces of
magic in all the classical forms of rationalism and science. Instead of
breaking through the circle of violence and the sacred as they imagined
they were doing, our predecessors re-created weakened variations of
myths and rituals.
In reality these myths have little importance. They are merely the
outposts of a stubborn resistance. By decoding mythology, revealing the
role of scapegoats in every culture, and resolving the enigmas of primi­
tive religion, we inevitably prepare the way for the forceful return of the
Gospel and biblical revelation. From the moment we truly understand
myths, we can no longer accept the Gospel as yet another myth, since
it is responsible for our understanding.
All our resistance is turned against the light that threatens us. It has
revealed so many things for so long a time without revealing itself that
we are convinced it comes from within us. We are wrong to appropriate
it. We think we are the light because we witness it. But as it increases in
brightness and scope it turns to itselffor enlightenment. As the light of
the Gospel extends to mythology it reveals its own specific nature.
The Gospel text is therefore in the process of justifying itself in the
course of an intellectual history that seems foreign to it because that his­
tory has transformed our vision in a way that is foreign to all the
religions of violence with which we foolishly confuse the Gospels. We
have reached a new stage in the progress of this history which, though
minor, bears heavy consequences for our intellectual and spiritual
stability. It dissipates the confusion and reveals the meaning of the
Gospel revelation as a critiq\)e of violent religion.
If that were not the meaning of the Gospels, then their own history
would have escaped them; they would not be as we see them. But that
is the meaning, under the rubric of the Holy Spirit. The great texts on
the Paraclete enlighten the process that we are now experiencing. Their
apparent obscurity is beginning to dissipate. The texts on the Holy
Spirit are understood not because of the decoding of mythology, but
because the light of the Gospels has penetrated myths and reduced them
to nothing, elucidating words that seemed meaningless and full of vio­
lence and superstition, because they proclaim this process in the form

206

T H E SCA PEG 0 AT

o f Christ's victory over Satan, or the victory of the Spirit o f truth over
the Spirit of falsehood. The passages in John's Gospel devoted to the
Paraclete group together all the themes of this book.
All these thoughts are found in Jesus' farewells to his disciples,
which constitute the high point of the fourth Gospel Modern Chris­
tians are somewhat bothered by seeing Satan reappear at such a solemn
moment John tells us that Jesus' justification in history and his authen­
tification are one with the annulment of Satan. This single and double
event is presented to us as already consummated by the Passion and also
not yet consummated, still to come since it is invisible to the eyes of the
disciples.
And when he comes,
he will show the world how wrong it was,
about sin,
and about who was in the right,
and about judgement:
about sin:
proved by their refusal to believe in me;
about who was in the right:
proved by my going to the Father
and your seeing me no more;
about judgement: (John 1 6:8- 1 1 )

There is between the Father and the world an abyss that comes from
the world itself and from its violence. Jesus' return to the Father sig­
nifies victory over violence and the crossing of the abyss. But at first no
one perceived this. For those who are in the world of violence Jesus is
merely dead like others. There will be no astounding message from him
or his Father after his return to his Father's side. Even if Jesus has be·
come divine, the process will take place constantly in the style of the an­
cient gods, in the perpetual circle of violence and the sacred. Under
these circumstances, the victory of the representation of persecution by
the persecutors seems assured.
Yet, Jesus tells us, that is not how things come to pass. By maintain­
ing the word of the Father against violence until the end and by dying
for it, Jesus has crossed the abyss separating mankind from the Father.
He himself becomes their Paraclete, their protector, and he sends them
another Paraclete who will not cease to work in the world to bring forth
the truth into the light.

Even if the language astonishes us, even if the author of the text
sometimes seems dizzy before the breadth of vision, we cannot help but
recognize what we have just been discussing. The Spirit is working in
history to reveal what Jesus has already revealed, the mechanism of the
scapegoat, the genesis of all mythology, the nonexistence of all gods of
violence. In the language of the Gospel the Spirit achieves the defeat
and condemnation of Satan. Based on the representation of persecution,
the world inevitably does not believe in Jesus. It cannot conceive of the
Passion's power of revelation. No system of thought is truly capable of
creating the thought capable of destroying it To confound the world,
therefore, and show that it is reasonable and just to believe in Jesus as
sent by the Father and returning to the Father after the Passion (in other
words as a divinity that shares nothing in common with those of vio­
lence), the Spirit is necessary in history to work to disintegrate the world
and gradually discredit all the gods of violence. It even appears to dis­
credit Christ in that the Christian Trinity, through the fault of Christian
and non-Christian alike, is compromised in the violence of the sacred.
In reality, the world's lack of belief is perpetuated and reinforced only
because the historical process is not yet complete, thus creating the illu­
sion of a Jesus demystified by the progress of knowledge and eliminated
with the other gods by history. History need only progress some more
and the Gospel will be verified. "Satan" is discredited and Christ
justified. Jesus' victory is thus, in principle, achieved immediately at the
moment of the Passion, but for most men it only takes shape in the
course of a long history secretly controlled by the revelation. It becomes
evident at the moment when we are convinced that, thanks to the
Gospels and not despite them, we can finally show the futility of all vio­
lent gods and explain and render void the whole of mythology.
Satan only reigns by virtue of the representations of persecution
that held sway prior to the Gospels. Satan therefore is essentially the
accuser, the one who deceives men by making them believe that inno­
cent victims are guilty. But, who is the Paraclete?
Parakleitos, in Greek, is the exact equivalent of advocate or the
Latin adJf.Jocatus. The Paraclete is called on behalf of the prisoner, the
victim, to speak in his place and in his name, to act in his defense. The
Paraclete is the universal advocate, the chief defender of all innocent
victims, the destroyer of every representation ofpersecution. He is truly the
spirit of truth that dissipates the fog of mythology.

208

T H E SC A P EG 0 A T

We must ask why Jerome, that formidable translator who was rarely
lacking in boldness, hesitated before the translation of the very ordinary,
common name ofparakleitos. He was literally taken by surprise. He did
not see the term's relevance and opted for a pure and simple translitera­
tion, Paracletus. His example is followed religiously in most modern
languages. This mysterious word has continued to put in concrete form
not the unintelligibility of a text that is actually perfectly intelligible,
but the unintelligence of its interpreters, that of Jesus' accusation of
his disciples, a lack of intelligence that history is slowly changing to
comprehension.
There are, ofcourse, innumerable studies on the Paraclete, but none
provides a satisfactory solution, since they all define the problem in nar­
rowly theological terms. The prodigious historical and cultural sig­
nificance of the term remains inaccessible, and the general conclusion is
that, if he is truly someone's advocate, the Paraclete must become the
disciples' advocate with the Father. This solution invokes a passage in
the first Epistle of John: "but if any one should sin, we have our advo­
cate with the Father, Jesus Christ, who is just" (2: I ) . . .
In John's text Jesus makes himself a Paraclete. In the Gospel by the
same author, Jesus effectively is shown as the first Paraclete sent to men:
I shall ask the Father,

and he will give you another Advocate
to be with you forever,
that Spirit of truth
whom the world can never receive
since it neither sees nor knows him; (John 1 4 : 1 6- 1 7)

Christ is the Paraclete, par ex�ellence, in the struggle agaii_Ist the
,
.
representation of persecution: Every defense and rehabilitation of vic­
t ims is based on the Passion's power of revelation. When Christ has
gone, the Spirit ofTruth, the second Paraclete, will make the light that
is already in the world shine for all men, though man will do everything
in his power not to see it.
The disciples certainly had no need of a second advocate with the
Father, as long as they had Jesus himself. The other Paraclete is sent
among men and into history; there is no need to get rid of him by send­
ing him piously into the transcendental. The immanent nature of his
action is confirmed by a text from the synoptic Gospels: "And when they
lead you fOrth to deliver you, do not be preoccupied with what you will

H I STORY AND T H E PARACLETE

209

say, but say what is given to you at the moment for it is not you who will
speak but the Holy Spirit?'
This text is problematic in itself. It does not quite say what it
intends to say. It would seem to say_ that martyrs need not be anxious
about their defense because the Holy Spirit will be there to defend
them. But there cannot be a question of an immediate triumph. The vic­
tims will not confound their accusers during their trial; they will be
martyred; there are many texts to confirm this; the Gospels do not imply
that they will put an end to persecutions.
It is a question neither ofindividual trials nor of some transcenden­
tal trial in which the Father plays the role of Accuser. This sort of
thinking, even with the best of intentions- hell is paved with them ­
constantly makes the Father into a satanic figure. There can only be a
question of an intermediary process between heaven and earth, the trial
of"heavenly" or "worldly" powers, and ofSatan himself, the trial of the
representation ofpersecution in its entirety. Because the Gospel writers
are not always able to define the place of trial they make it sometimes too
transcendent or too immanent, and modern commentators have never
escaped this double hesitation, not understanding that the destiny of all
sacred violence is at stake in the battle between the Accuser, Satan, and
the advocate for the defense, the Paraclete.
What the martyrs say has little importance because they are wit­
nesses, not of a determined belief, as is imagined, but of man's terrible
propensity, in a group, to spill innocent blood in order to restore the
unity of their community. The persecutors force themselves to bury
their dead in the tomb of their representation of persecution, but the
more martyrs die the weaker the representation becomes and the more
striking the testimony. This is why we use the term martyr, which
means witness, for all the innocent victims, regardless of differences of
belief or doctrine, as the Gospels proclaim. Just as in the word scapegoat,
the popular usage of martyr goes further than scholarly interpretations
and suggests for theology things that are as yet unknown.
While the world is still intact it cannot understand that which tran­
scends the representation of persecution; it can neither see the Paraclete
nor know him. The disciples themselves are still encumbered with illu­
sions that only history can destroy by the deepening influence of the
Passion. Thus the future will revive words to the disciples that were not
able to claim their attention at the time because they seemed to be

210

T H E S C A P E G O AT

deprived of meaning: "I have said these things to you, while still with
you; but the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in
my name, will teach you everything and remind you of all I have said to
you?' (John 1 4:25-26)
I still have many things to say to you
but they would be too much for you now.
But when the Spirit of truth comes
he will lead you to the complete truth,
since he will not be speaking as from himself
but will say only what he has learned;
and he will tell you of the things to come.
He will glorify me,
since all he tells you
will be taken from what is mine. (John 1 6 : 1 2- 1 5)

Of all the texts on the Paraclete, this, finally, is the most extraordi­
nary. It appears to be made up of heterogeneous pieces and fragments,
as if it were the incoherent fruit of a mystical schizophrenia. Actually,
it is our own cultural schizophrenia that makes it appear that way. It
cannot be understood so long as we use the principles and methods that
inevitably belong to our world and can neither see nor know the
Paraclete. John strikes us with so many extraordinary truths at such a
pace that we neither can nor want to absorb them. There is a great risk
of projecting on him the confusion and violence that are always to some
extent present in us. The text may have been affected, in certain details,
by the conflicts between the Church and the Synagogue, but its real
subject has nothing to do with contemporary debates on the "anti­
Semitism of ]ohn?'
Anyone who hates me hates my Father.
If I had not performed such works among them
as no one else has ever done,
they would be blameless;
but as it is, they have seen all this,
and still they hate both me and my Father.
But all this was only to fulfill the words written in their Law;
They hated me for no reason.
When the Advocate [Paraclete] comes,
whom I shall send to you from the Father,
the Spirit of truth who issues from the Father.
he will be my witness [ekeinos marturesei peri emou]

HISTORY AND T H E PARACLETE

211

And you too will be witnesses, [ kai humeis d e martureite]
because you have been with me from the outset.
"I have told you all this

so that your faith may not be shaken.
They will expell you from the synagogues,
and indeed the hour is coming
when anyone who kills you will think he is doing a holy duty for God.
They will do these things
because they have never known either the Father or myself.
But I have told you all this,
so that when the time for it comes
you may remember that I told you. (John 1 5:23-27; 1 6 : 1 -4)

This text unquestionably evokes the struggles and persecutions at
the time of its writing. It cannot directly evoke any others. But in­
directly it evokes all the others since it is not dominated by vengeance
but rather dominates it. To regard it as purely and simply a prefiguration
of contemporary anti-semitism, under the pretext that it has never been
understood, is to give in to scandal, to transform into scandal what we
are told has been given to us to protect us from scandal and foresee the
misunderstandings caused by the apparent failure of the revelation.
Apparently, the revelation is a failure; it ends in persecutions that
seem likely to smother it but ultimately bring it to fulfillment. So long
as the words ofJesus do not reach us, we have no sin. We remain at the
level of the Gerasenes. The representation of persecution retains a cer­
tain legitimacy. The sin is the resistance to the revelation. Inevitably, it
becomes externalized in the hateful persecution of the one who brings
the revelation, in other words God himself, since he is the one who dis­
turbs our more or less comfortable little arrangements with our familiar
demons.
The persecutor's resistance- Paul's for example, before his
conversion-makes the very thing that it tries to hide obvious. As a con­
verted persecutor, Paul is the archetypal Christian:
He fell to the ground and then he heard a voice saying, "Saul, Saul, why are you
persecuting me?" "Who are you, Lord?" he asked, and the voice answered, "I am
Jesus, and you are persecuting me:' (Acts 9:4-6)

I see in this the perfect theoretical recapitulation of the evangelic
process that is described in all the texts discussed in the preceding

212

T H E SCAPEGOAT

pages. The same process also takes place i n history and develops from
now on as history; it is known to the whole world, and it is the same as
the advent of the Paraclete. When the Paraclete comes, Jesus says, he
will bear witness to me, he will reveal the meaning of my innocent death
and ofevery innocent death, from the beginning to the end of the world.
Those who come after Christ will therefore bear witness as he did, less
by their words or beliefs than by becoming martyrs and dying as Jesus
died.
Most assuredly, this concerns not only the early Christians per­
secuted by the Jews or by the Romans but also the Jews who were later
persecuted by the Christians and all victims persecuted by executioners.
To what does it really bear witness? In my thinking it always relates to
the collective persecution that gives birth to religious illusions. It is to
this that the following sentence alludes: "the hour is coming when who­
ever kills you will think he is offering service to God." Witch-hunters are
encompassed by this revelation, as are totalitarian bureaucrats of perse­
cution. In future, all violence will reveal what Christ's Passion revealed,
the foolish genesis of bloodstained idols and the false gods of religion,
politics, and ideologies. The murderers remain convinced of the worthi­
ness of their sacrifices. They, too, know not what they do and we must
forgive them. The time has come for us to forgive one another. If we
wait any longer there will not be time enough.
