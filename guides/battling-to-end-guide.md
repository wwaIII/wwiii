# Battling to the End: A Guide for Competitive Strategy

**Rene Girard in conversation with Benoit Chantre on Clausewitz's *On War***

> For a CEO navigating competitive industries: When to fight, when to differentiate, and how to avoid destroying yourself in the process.

## 1. The Big Idea

Girard reads Clausewitz's military treatise *On War* and discovers something terrifying: **war has an inherent logic of escalation that politics cannot contain**. Once rivals engage, mimetic forces take over. Each side imitates the other, matches their intensity, and raises the stakes. The "trend to extremes" becomes unstoppable.

| Clausewitz Thought | Girard's Reading |
|-------------------|------------------|
| War is politics by other means | Politics *loses control* to war's logic |
| Absolute war is just a concept | Absolute war is where we're heading |
| Rational actors can contain violence | Mimetic rivalry overrides rationality |
| The goal is victory | The goal becomes mutual destruction |

**The core warning:** Competition doesn't stay contained. Rivals become mirrors of each other. The very act of opposing someone makes you more like them. And the cycle accelerates until both parties are exhausted or destroyed.

## 2. Clausewitz Through Girard's Lens

### The Duel as Escalation Engine

Clausewitz opens *On War* with a striking image: war is essentially a **duel** - two wrestlers, each trying to throw the other.

> "War is nothing but a duel on a larger scale. Countless duels go to make up war, but a picture of it as a whole can be formed by imagining a pair of wrestlers."

Girard sees this as the core insight Clausewitz himself didn't fully grasp:

| Clausewitz's Three "Reciprocal Actions" | What They Actually Mean |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Unlimited application of force | Each side matches the other's intensity |
| Aim to disarm the enemy | Both sides pursue total victory simultaneously |
| Maximum exertion of strength | Resources escalate until exhaustion |

**Key insight:** These aren't three separate dynamics - they're all manifestations of **mimetic reciprocity**. Each action provokes a mirror response. Each response raises the stakes.

### The "Friction" Problem

Clausewitz tried to rescue his theory by introducing "friction" - real-world factors that slow escalation:
- Weather, terrain, morale
- Political constraints
- "Armed observation" (standoffs)

But Girard argues: **friction is temporary. The escalation logic remains.** Napoleon proved that a sufficiently motivated force could overcome friction. And once one side does, the other must match them or lose.

## 3. Mimetic Rivalry & Violence

### The Reciprocity Trap

The fundamental insight Girard brings to Clausewitz:

```
A attacks B
    |
    v
B must respond (or appear weak)
    |
    v
B's response = A's initial attack (minimum)
    |
    v
A must escalate (or lose initiative)
    |
    v
Cycle repeats at higher intensity
```

**Why this happens:**
- Rivals watch each other obsessively
- Each side learns from the other's tactics
- Success gets imitated immediately
- Differentiation collapses into sameness

### The Model-Obstacle Paradox

This is Girard's crucial contribution:

| Your Competitor Is... | Which Means... |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Your **model** | You imitate their moves, strategies, positioning |
| Your **obstacle** | They stand between you and what you want |
| Both simultaneously | You become locked in mimetic embrace |

> "The model-obstacle: the rival you imitate becomes the very thing blocking your success."

**In business terms:** The competitor you study most closely becomes the competitor you most resemble. You adopt their playbook. You chase their customers. You match their prices. You lose differentiation.

### Undifferentiation: The Endgame

As rivalry intensifies:
1. Differences between rivals **collapse**
2. Each side becomes a mirror of the other
3. Neither can articulate why they're different
4. The fight becomes about *winning*, not *value creation*

> "Undifferentiation is the state of a social group threatened by mimetic crisis: violence is so widespread that all differences have disappeared."

## 4. Applications to Competition

### The Google Ads Parallel

William - your industry exemplifies mimetic rivalry:

| War Dynamic | Google Ads Equivalent |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Escalation to extremes | Bidding wars that destroy margins |
| Armed observation | Monitoring competitor keywords/spend |
| Reciprocal action | Matching competitor offers/pricing |
| Undifferentiation | All agencies making the same promises |
| Friction (temporary) | Platform rules, budget constraints |

### When You're Caught in Mimetic Competition

**Signs you're in the trap:**
- You define yourself against a specific competitor
- You match their moves within days/weeks
- Your strategy meetings focus on "what they're doing"
- You're competing on price or features they created
- Victory feels like survival, not success

**The Clausewitzian warning:** "In war the result is never final." Each "win" just sets up the next round. The competition becomes self-perpetuating.

### The Napoleon Trap

Clausewitz was *obsessed* with Napoleon - studied him, hated him, wanted to defeat him. But Girard shows: this obsession made Clausewitz into Napoleon's mirror.

> "Clausewitz's military religion, which made ideological wars possible, involves a confusion of orders... The hidden structure of this theory operates like an imitation of the Napoleonic model."

**For business:** The competitor you obsess over shapes you. You become them. You fight their war on their terms.

## 5. De-escalation & Containment

### Why It's So Hard

Girard is pessimistic. He argues traditional containment mechanisms have broken down:

| Old Containment | Why It Fails Now |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Political limits on war | Business has no referee |
| "Rules of engagement" | Disruptors ignore them |
| Mutual exhaustion | New funding arrives |
| Clear victory | Markets don't end |

### What Can Work

**1. Exit the Duel**

The only way to stop escalation is to **stop participating in the reciprocal dynamic**:
- Refuse to match competitor moves
- Create new categories they can't follow
- Serve customers they're ignoring
- Build what they can't imitate

> "The only way of not returning to a crusade, of escaping from the violent reciprocity... is to not give in."

**2. Recognize the Mimetic Pattern**

Awareness breaks the spell:
- Notice when you're reacting rather than creating
- Track how much mindshare competitors consume
- Ask: "Would we do this if they didn't exist?"

**3. Find Your "Pope" Position**

Girard admires how the papacy survived by being *appropriable by none*:
> "The papacy's mimetism has slowly been refined and purified in the heat of unceasing struggle. Today it offers us a model we can identify with safely."

**In business:** Position yourself as the neutral standard, the platform everyone needs, the infrastructure no one can own. **Become un-opposable.**

**4. The Defensive Advantage**

Clausewitz (and Girard) note that defense is inherently stronger:
> "Defense is the stronger form of war."

**Applied:** Don't chase. Let competitors exhaust themselves attacking. Build moats. Compound advantages. Force them to fight your war.

## 6. Modern Relevance

### Business Competition

| Girardian Concept | Business Application |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Escalation to extremes | Price wars, feature wars, ad spend wars |
| Mimetic rivalry | Copying competitor playbooks |
| Undifferentiation | Commodity markets, race to bottom |
| Model-obstacle | The competitor you study most is shaping you |
| Scapegoating | Blaming losses on market conditions |
| Armed observation | Competitive intelligence without action |

### Relationships & Negotiations

The same dynamics apply:
- Tit-for-tat escalation in disputes
- Couples becoming mirrors of each other
- Negotiations where "winning" matters more than outcomes
- Political polarization (each side becoming what they oppose)

### The Terrorism Parallel

Girard wrote this in 2007, seeing terrorism as the latest form of escalation:
> "Terrorism has raised the level of violence up a notch again. This phenomenon is mimetic and opposes two crusades, two forms of fundamentalism."

His warning: asymmetric conflict still follows mimetic logic. Responses shape adversaries. "The West is going to exhaust itself in its fight against Islamic terrorism, which Western arrogance has undeniably kindled."

## 8. Quotable Lines

> "War is nothing but a duel on a larger scale... Each tries through physical force to compel the other to do his will."
> *- Clausewitz (via Girard)*

---

> "The escalation to extremes is the implacable law... The protective system of scapegoats is finally destroyed by the Crucifixion narratives as they reveal Jesus' innocence."
> *- Girard on what happens when old containment fails*

---

> "To make the Revelation wholly good, and not threatening at all, humans have only to adopt the behavior recommended by Christ: abstain completely from retaliation, and renounce the escalation to extremes."
> *- Girard's radical prescription*

---

## The Bottom Line for William

**The competitive game you're playing has a built-in logic that destroys both players.**

You can't win a mimetic war. You can only:
1. **Exit it** - create new categories, new markets, new rules
2. **Refuse to play** - don't match, differentiate
3. **Become un-opposable** - be the platform, not the player
4. **Let them attack** - defense is stronger than offense

The competitor you obsess over is shaping you into their image. The bidding war you're winning is depleting you both. The victory you're chasing sets up the next defeat.

**The only way out is to stop wanting what they want.**
