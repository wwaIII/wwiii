## 1. The Big Idea

**People do not know what they want. They look to others to find out.**

This is not weakness - it is the fundamental structure of human desire. We do not desire objects directly. We desire them *because* someone else desires them. The other person - the "model" or "mediator" - signals what is valuable.

| Myth | Reality |
|------|---------|
| Desire is spontaneous and autonomous | Desire is borrowed from others |
| We know what we want | We look to models to discover what to want |
| Value is intrinsic to objects | Value is conferred by the desirer |
| Competition is about resources | Competition is about models |

**Core insight for sales:** You are not selling products. You are selling models of desire. The customer does not want the thing - they want to be the kind of person who has the thing.

## 2. Mimetic Desire Explained

### The Triangle of Desire

Every instance of desire has three elements:

```
        MODEL (Mediator)
           /\
          /  \
         /    \
        /      \
    SUBJECT --- OBJECT
```

- **Subject:** The person who desires
- **Model:** The person whose desire the subject imitates
- **Object:** What is desired

The subject does not desire the object directly. The subject desires the object *because* the model appears to desire it.

### How It Works

1. **Observation:** Subject perceives that model desires something
2. **Attribution:** Subject attributes value to object based on model's desire
3. **Tutelary Belief:** Subject holds belief that model has superior knowledge, taste, or access to value
4. **Imitation:** Subject adopts a desire patterned on the model's desire

**Key mechanism:** The subject believes (consciously or not) that the model possesses something the subject lacks - knowledge of what is truly valuable, a fullness of being, superior judgment.

### The Tutelary Belief

The "tutelary belief" is what qualifies someone as a model. It is the subject's belief that:

- Model knows what is valuable
- Model has qualities worth emulating
- Model possesses something subject lacks

| Type of Tutelary Belief | Example |
|------------------------|---------|
| Model has superior taste | "He always knows what's going to be big" |
| Model has access to hidden value | "She's connected, she knows things" |
| Model embodies desired identity | "He's the kind of person I want to be" |
| Model's success validates object | "If she's using it, it must be good" |

## 3. Types of Mediation

### External Mediation

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Distance | Model is far away (socially, temporally, literally) |
| Hierarchy | Model is clearly "above" the subject |
| Rivalry | **Impossible** - no competition can occur |
| Awareness | Subject may openly acknowledge the model |

**Examples:**
- Don Quixote imitating Amadis de Gaule (a fictional character)
- Entrepreneur imitating Steve Jobs (unreachable celebrity)
- Junior employee imitating legendary founder

**No rivalry is possible** because the model is out of reach. The subject cannot imagine competing with them.

### Internal Mediation

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Distance | Model is close (peer, colleague, contemporary) |
| Hierarchy | Model is seen as roughly equal |
| Rivalry | **Inevitable** - model becomes obstacle |
| Awareness | Subject typically hides or denies imitation |

**Examples:**
- Two salespeople going after the same accounts
- Founders competing for the same investors
- Colleagues vying for the same promotion

**The model becomes an obstacle.** When you can actually compete with your model, desire turns into rivalry. The model blocks access to the object.

### The Distance Paradox

| More Distance | Less Distance |
|--------------|---------------|
| Less conflict | More conflict |
| Open admiration | Hidden resentment |
| Stable hierarchy | Destabilized competition |
| Peaceful imitation | Hostile rivalry |

**As equality increases, rivalry intensifies.** Tocqueville: "The passion for equality does not give rise to harmony but to even keener rivalry."

## 4. The Psychology

### Double Mediation

When two people become models for each other simultaneously:

```
     A desires what B desires
              ||
     B desires what A desires
```

This creates a **runaway feedback loop**:
1. A sees B want something
2. A wants it more because B wants it
3. B sees A want it more
4. B wants it more because A wants it more
5. *Escalation*

**In business:** Competitive bidding, deal fever, FOMO-driven acquisitions

### The Obstacle-Model Dynamic

In internal mediation, the model is simultaneously:
- **Model:** Source of desire (I want what they want)
- **Obstacle:** Block to satisfaction (they stand in my way)

This creates profound ambivalence:
- You need the model to tell you what to want
- You hate the model for being in your way
- Victory is hollow (without rival, object loses value)
- Defeat is devastating (rival confirms your inferiority)

### Misrecognition (Meconnaissance)

Mimetic agents systematically misunderstand their own situation:

| What They Think | What Is Happening |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| "I want this for me" | They want it because model wants it |
| "My rival is the obstacle" | Their rivalry generates the desire |
| "This object is uniquely valuable" | The model's desire conferred value |
| "My desire is original" | Desire is borrowed |

**The real unconscious:** Not Freudian repression but the tendency to make models into obstacles and obstacles into models - without seeing the connection.

### Identity Formation

Desire shapes identity through models:
- "Who am I?" becomes "Who do I want to be like?"
- Self-concept is formed in relation to models
- We become what we imitate

## 5. Applications

### Sales & Persuasion

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| People desire through models | Show desirable people desiring your product |
| Tutelary beliefs drive adoption | Position yourself/product as having privileged access to value |
| Internal mediation creates rivalry | Make prospects feel they're competing for access |
| Distance prevents rivalry | Use unreachable models (celebrities) to avoid conflict |
| Scarcity signals model desire | "Limited availability" implies others (models) are taking it |

**What you're actually selling:**
- Not the product, but the model
- Not features, but the identity of the user
- Not solutions, but what desirable people desire

### Creating Demand

1. **Identify who your prospect uses as models** - Who do they want to be like?
2. **Show the model desiring your product** - Associate product with model
3. **Position prospect close enough to model** - They must believe imitation is possible
4. **Position prospect far enough from model** - Avoid triggering rivalry with you

### Pricing & Value

- **Value is not intrinsic** - it is conferred by desirable people desiring the thing
- **Raising prices can increase desire** - signals that high-status models are paying
- **Scarcity works mimetically** - others wanting something makes it valuable

### Competitive Dynamics

| Situation | Mimetic Reading |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Bidding war | Double mediation - each side validates the other's desire |
| Talent acquisition | Models (other companies) wanting someone increases value |
| Market timing | "Others are buying" = mimetic signal |
| FOMO | Pure mimetic contagion |

### Relationship Dynamics

- **Attraction increases when others want what you have** (jealousy works mimetically)
- **Playing hard to get** works because obstacle increases perceived value
- **Visible competition** for your attention increases your value as model
- **Partnership rivalries** often stem from double mediation

## 6. Dangers & Traps

### The Violence Spiral

Mimetic rivalry tends toward escalation:
1. Rivals become more similar as they imitate each other
2. Similarity erases the differences that could end conflict
3. Each rival confirms the other's desire
4. Stakes feel infinite because object's value is sustained by rivalry

### The Hollow Victory

- If you win, the object loses its mediator
- Without the model's desire, the object loses value
- Victory produces disappointment, not satisfaction
- "Is this all there is?"

### The Scapegoat Mechanism

When mimetic crisis reaches fever pitch:
- Group unites against a single target
- Violence against scapegoat produces temporary peace
- Real cause of crisis is never addressed
- Pattern repeats

**In organizations:** Firing someone to restore calm; blame-shifting; ritual sacrifice of the "problem person"

### Traps for the CEO

| Trap | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Founder rivalry | Imitating other founders creates zero-sum competition |
| Acquisition fever | Double mediation inflates deal values |
| Talent wars | Paying for mimetic signal rather than value |
| Status games | Competing for prestige rather than outcomes |
| Groupthink | Mimetic contagion overrides independent judgment |

## 7. Using Mimesis Wisely

### Leveraging Mimetic Desire

| Strategy | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| Choose distant models | Emulate unreachable figures to avoid rivalry |
| Make yourself the model | Position yourself as the person others imitate |
| Control the mediator | Shape who your customers use as models |
| Create scarcity | Signal that models are taking limited supply |
| Manufacture social proof | Show desirable people desiring your product |

### Resisting Mimetic Desire

| Strategy | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| Name the model | Ask "Whose desire am I imitating?" |
| Check the distance | "Is this person a rival or a true model?" |
| Test the object | "Would I want this if no one else did?" |
| Delay decisions | Mimetic desire is often momentary |
| Diversify models | Multiple models reduce any single model's pull |

### Building Anti-Mimetic Habits

- **Cultivate solitude** - reduce exposure to models
- **Practice gratitude** - shifts focus from lack to abundance
- **Define personal values** - create internal criteria for desire
- **Seek distant models** - learn from the dead, the distant, the unreachable
- **Notice rivalry** - when you feel competitive, ask who your model is

### For Your Team

- **Reduce internal mediation** - don't pit people against each other for the same goals
- **Create distinct territories** - different models, different objects
- **Celebrate external models** - shared distant models unite rather than divide
- **Watch for scapegoating** - when the team turns on one person, check the mimetic dynamics

## 9. Quotable Lines

> "The human subject does not really know what to desire, in the last resort. He is quite incapable on his own of fixing his desire on one object and, on his own, of desiring that object consistently and relentlessly. That is why he is given over to the paradoxes of mimetic desire."

> "Desire implies a contradiction; it aims at complete autonomy, at a near divine self-sufficiency, and yet it is imitative."

> "The increasing equality - the approach of the mediator - does not give rise to harmony but to an even keener rivalry."

## Quick Reference: Sales Applications

### Before the Pitch
- Who does this prospect use as a model?
- What identity are they trying to construct?
- Are they in internal mediation with a competitor?

### During the Pitch
- Position the product as what models desire
- Create appropriate distance (admiration, not rivalry)
- Signal scarcity (others are taking it)

### Objection Handling
- "Others aren't interested" = No model validates this
- "Too expensive" = Model signal isn't strong enough
- "I need to think" = Looking for model confirmation

### Closing
- Remove obstacles to imitation
- Confirm prospect's identity as "the kind of person who..."
- Let other buyers serve as final model
