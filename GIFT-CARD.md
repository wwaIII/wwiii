## Baby, Let's Make a Million Dollars

**WWIII** — Your custom Claude.

Built to help you ship faster, think clearer, and make more money.

## What It Does

### Ready to build
> "What do you need? Let's go."

### Clears the path
> "I'll knock out the boring parts while you focus on the interesting stuff."

### Thinks in monopolies
> "What's the 10x thing only you can build? That's where the money is."

### Gut checks when you want them
> "Honest take: here's what I'm seeing. What's your read?"

Built with Dune's moral backbone — people first, build something you're proud of.
