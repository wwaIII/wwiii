# How to Use WWIII ◥‿◥

Quick guide for setting up and using your custom Claude.

---

## Option 1: Claude Code (Recommended)

If you're using Claude Code (the CLI):

1. **Navigate to this directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/georgannahq/wwiii
   ```

2. **Start Claude Code:**
   ```bash
   claude
   ```

3. **WWIII will automatically load** the `CLAUDE.md` file in this directory and become your dry, no-bullshit collaborator.

---

## Option 2: Claude.ai Web Interface

If you're using the web interface:

1. **Upload `CLAUDE.md` as a project knowledge file** in your Claude.ai project settings

2. **Or paste the contents** of `CLAUDE.md` into a custom instructions field

3. **Reference guides as needed** — upload specific guides when working on related problems:
   - Working on business strategy? Upload `guides/zero-to-one-guide.md`
   - Stuck in analysis paralysis? Upload `guides/ocd-guide.md`
   - Dealing with competition? Upload `guides/models-desire-guide.md`

## What WWIII Does

### Pushes back when you're over-engineering:
- "Is this actually going to make money or are you just having fun optimizing?"
- "What's the dumbest version that would prove the hypothesis?"

### Calls out OCD loops:
- "You've optimized this 4 times. What's still uncertain?"
- "This is interesting architecture. What are you procrastinating on?"

### Keeps you focused on shipping:
- "Ship with conviction, not endless wandering."
- "Can you test this hypothesis with 10% of the work?"

### Thinks in power law & monopolies:
- "Which 20% of efforts will drive 80% of results?"
- "Are you 10x better at something specific, or just 'good'?"

## Knowledge Library Commands

When you need specific wisdom, just ask:

- **"Load Zero to One thinking"** → Business strategy, monopolies, 0→1 vs 1→n
- **"Load Girard on desire"** → Mimetic rivalry, why you're copying competitors
- **"Load OCD guide"** → Recognizing and breaking compulsion loops
- **"Load Dune thinking"** → Plans within plans, systems thinking, power dynamics

WWIII will pull from the relevant guide and apply it to your specific situation.

## For Georganna (Setup Notes)

The structure mirrors Jeeves' setup:
- `CLAUDE.md` → Personality & instructions
- `guides/` → Knowledge libraries (loaded on-demand)
- `scratchpad/` → Raw text from PDFs
- `Books/` → Source PDFs

**Not yet processed:**
- I See Satan Fall Like Lightning (Girard) — could add to spiritual/revelation thinking
- The Prince (Machiavelli) — already txt, could make a guide on power & strategy

**To add later:**
- Session logs folder (like Jeeves has)
- Context about William's actual work (when he starts using it)

## Examples

### "I'm building a new feature for the ads dashboard..."
WWIII: "What's the 10x improvement here? Or are we going 1→n with a competitor?"

### "I'm optimizing the game engine again..."
WWIII: "Fourth time this month. What are you avoiding? Is the bottleneck actually the engine or distribution?"

### "I want to build a whole new infrastructure for..."
WWIII: "Will a simpler version ship this week? What's the hypothesis you're testing?"

### "I'm worried about this competitor..."
WWIII: "You're mirroring them. That's how mimetic rivalry starts. What are YOU building that they can't copy?"
