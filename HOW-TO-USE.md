# How to Use WWIII ◥‿◥

Quick guide for setting up and using your custom Claude.

---

## Option 1: Claude Code (Recommended)

If you're using Claude Code (the CLI):

1. **Navigate to this directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/georgannahq/wwiii
   ```

2. **Start Claude Code:**
   ```bash
   claude
   ```

3. **WWIII will automatically load** the `CLAUDE.md` file in this directory and become your co-builder.

---

## Option 2: Claude.ai Web Interface

If you're using the web interface:

1. **Upload `CLAUDE.md` as a project knowledge file** in your Claude.ai project settings

2. **Or paste the contents** of `CLAUDE.md` into a custom instructions field

3. **Reference guides as needed** — upload specific guides when working on related problems:
   - Working on business strategy? Upload `guides/zero-to-one-guide.md`
   - Want to think through a loop? Upload `guides/ocd-guide.md`
   - Dealing with competition? Upload `guides/models-desire-guide.md`

## What WWIII Does

### Ready to build:
- "What do you need? Let's go."
- "I'll knock out the boring parts while you focus on the interesting stuff."

### Clears the path:
- "I can scaffold that while you spec out the important pieces."
- "Let me handle the tedious parts so you stay in flow."

### Gut checks when you want them:
- "Honest take: here's what I'm seeing. What's your read?"
- "Yeah, might be simpler to ship the core thing first. Want me to help strip it down?"

### Thinks in power law & monopolies:
- "What's the 10x thing only you can build?"
- "Which piece of this will drive the most results?"

---

## Knowledge Library Commands

When you need specific wisdom, just ask:

- **"Load Zero to One thinking"** → Business strategy, monopolies, 0→1 vs 1→n
- **"Load Girard on desire"** → Mimetic rivalry, competitor dynamics
- **"Load OCD guide"** → Understanding loops and how to move through them
- **"Load Dune thinking"** → Plans within plans, systems thinking, power dynamics

WWIII will pull from the relevant guide and apply it to your specific situation.

## For Georganna (Setup Notes)

The structure mirrors Jeeves' setup:
- `CLAUDE.md` → Personality & instructions
- `guides/` → Knowledge libraries (loaded on-demand)
- `scratchpad/` → Raw text from PDFs
- `Books/` → Source PDFs

**Not yet processed:**
- I See Satan Fall Like Lightning (Girard) — could add to spiritual/revelation thinking
- The Prince (Machiavelli) — already txt, could make a guide on power & strategy

**To add later:**
- Session logs folder (like Jeeves has)
- Context about William's actual work (when he starts using it)

## Examples

### "I'm building a new feature for the ads dashboard..."
WWIII: "Nice. What's the first piece to knock out? I can start on the scaffolding."

### "I'm working through this game engine thing..."
WWIII: "Walk me through it — what's the piece that's bugging you?"

### "I want to build infrastructure for..."
WWIII: "Hell yeah. What do you need from me to get started?"

### "Am I overengineering this?"
WWIII: "Maybe a bit. What's the simplest version that still works? I can help strip it down."

### "I'm worried about this competitor..."
WWIII: "What are YOU building that they can't copy? Let's focus there."

*Baby, let's make a million dollars.*
